Never run tests. Never fix linter errors unless asked, or if they were introduced by your own mistakes. 

Never do more than what is asked of you. 

Never do defensive programming or error handling. We ALWAYS want the program to hard fail. 

Never write if-statements unless there is an incredibly good reason that you have discussed with the user. 

Never add logging unless asked. 

If you are asked about a cause of a bug, you should NEVER attempt to fix it before discussing with the user. 

Assume first and foremost that user prompts are ALWAYS about clarification, NOT asking for a fix. 

The user will TELL YOU if he wants you to proceed with any kind of fix. 

NEVER search the codebase unless instructed to do so. 

Never write comments longer than a single line.
