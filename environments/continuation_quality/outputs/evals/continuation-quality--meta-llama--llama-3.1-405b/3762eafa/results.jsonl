Thus it is clear that such a vast reorganization of the timing of gene expression is closely connected to the CDK machinery [14]. Further evidence for the possibility of a transcriptional cell cycle clock was uncovered by Simmons Kovacs et al. arguing that, in cells arrested in late G1 by pheromone treatment, only a small set of genes is periodically transcribed. This set of genes includes SWI4 (which encodes a component of the SBF transcription factor) and HCM1 (which is involved in chromosome organization and periodic transcription of various genes involved in spindle function). Although these cells could not replicate, bud, or divide, the ordinarily periodic transcription of SWI4 and HCM1 continued for up to 5 days, with a period slightly shorter than the ~60 minute period of the mitotic cell cycle. The authors argued that this periodic behavior may be related to an autonomous transcriptional cell cycle clock [23]. The observations of Orlando et al. and Simmons Kovacs et al. suggest a picture of the cell cycle in which an independent transcriptional clock mechanism oscillates with a period of approximately one cell cycle, while being entrained to the cell cycle by the CDK oscillator, as shown in Figure 2-2. Figure 2-2B shows an alternative picture in which the transcriptional clock is not an independently ticking autonomous oscillator, but merely a set of phase markers, driven to express at a certain almost periodic schedule by the activity of the cyclinCDK network.
