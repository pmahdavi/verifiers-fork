## Problem Type 1: mc-standalone

**Features**: Text-only, Choices NOT shown, Answer = actual value

### INPUT:
```
System: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.

User:
### Question 1. 

A guard works in a company with three employees named Ali, Hossein, and Majid. 
The guard must be present at work every day unless all three employees are on leave. 
We know that:
* Ali takes a leave every other day and is at work today.
* Hossein works for $5$ days and then takes leave for $2$ days. Yesterday was his 
  first day of work after a leave.
* Majid works for $3$ days and then takes leave for $1$ day. He was on leave yesterday.

In how many days will the guard have his first day off?

Provide your answer inside \boxed{}.
```

### ACTUAL OUTPUT (Gemini-2.5-Pro):
```
[Note: This example contained two questions, showing Gemini's response to a compound problem]

Here is the step-by-step solution for both questions.

### Analysis of Question 11

First, let's establish the rules of Wonderland:
* Honest Smart (HS): Tells the truth.
* Villain Fool (VF): Tells the truth.
* Honest Fool (HF): Lies.
* Villain Smart (VS): Lies.

[... detailed logical reasoning ...]

The correct statement for Question 11 is **2. I am an honest fool.**

### Analysis of Question 12

[... step-by-step analysis ...]

**Conclusion:**
A is an Honest Smart person, and B is an Honest Fool.

\boxed{A: Honest Smart\nB: Honest Fool}
```

**Expected Answer**: `\boxed{11}`  
**Actual Answer**: Complex text answer (format correct, but answer incorrect for this specific problem)  
**Grading**: Reward = 0.0 (incorrect answer), Format = 1.0 (correct `\boxed{}` usage)

**Key Points**:
- ❌ Choices are NOT shown (even though they exist in the dataset)
- ✓ LLM must calculate the answer independently
- ✓ Answer should be the actual value, not an option number
- ✓ LLM used correct `\boxed{}` format (100% format adherence)

### Question 3. 

The figure below shows $6$ cities and the roads between them. The numbers between 
consecutive cities indicate the distance between them. We want to build a gas station 
on a road or in one of the cities such that the sum of the distances from different 
cities to the gas station, which we call $Y$, is minimized. What is the integer part 
of $Y$?

[Image showing cities and roads]

Provide your answer inside \boxed{}.
```

**Expected Answer**: `\boxed{76}`

**Technical Format**:
```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    {"type": "text", "text": "..."},
    {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo..."}}
  ]
}
```

**Key Points**:
- ✓ Image embedded as data URI
- ❌ Choices NOT shown (standalone)
- ✓ Answer is actual value

## Problem Type 3: mc-dependent

**Features**: Text-only, Choices ARE shown, Answer = option number

### INPUT:

[Problem about farmer planting crops with rules]

In the first year, he plants beans, corn, and cabbage. What will he plant in the third year?

1. Peas, corn, beans
2. Peas, cabbage, beans
3. Zucchini, peas, beans
4. Zucchini, peas, cabbage
5. Cabbage, corn, beans

Provide the number of the correct option (1-5) inside \boxed{}.
```

### ACTUAL OUTPUT (Gemini-2.5-Pro):
```
Here is a step-by-step logical deduction to find the crops planted in the third year.

**Let's denote the crops by their first letter:**
* B: Beans
* C: Corn
* A: Cabbage (to avoid confusion with Corn)
* Z: Zucchini
* P: Peas

**The rules are:**
1. Plant exactly 3 crops each year.
2. If C is planted, B must be planted (C → B).
3. Cabbage (A) is not planted in consecutive years.
4. No more than one crop is replanted from the previous year (Overlap ≤ 1).

**Given Information:**
* **Year 1:** {Beans, Corn, Cabbage} which is {B, C, A}.

### **Step 1: Determine the crops for Year 2**

[... detailed logical reasoning analyzing each rule ...]

* **Conclusion for Year 2:** The single replanted crop is Beans (B), and the other 
  two must be the new crops, Zucchini (Z) and Peas (P).
  * **Year 2 must be: {Beans, Zucchini, Peas} or {B, Z, P}.**

### **Step 2: Determine the crops for Year 3**

[... step-by-step analysis of Year 3 ...]

* **Conclusion for Year 3:** The two new crops are Corn (C) and Cabbage (A), and 
  the single replanted crop is Beans (B).
  * **Year 3 must be: {Beans, Corn, Cabbage} or {B, C, A}.**

### **Final Check:**

Let's look at the options provided and find the one that matches our conclusion 
{Beans, Corn, Cabbage}.

1. Peas, corn, beans
2. Peas, cabbage, beans
3. Zucchini, peas, beans
4. Zucchini, peas, cabbage
5. **Cabbage, corn, beans**

Option 5 is the correct combination.

\boxed{5}
```

**Expected Answer**: `\boxed{5}`  
**Actual Answer**: `\boxed{5}`  
**Grading**: ✅ **CORRECT!** Reward = 1.0, Format = 1.0

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Choices ARE shown (dependent problem) - Gemini saw all 5 options
- ✅ LLM analyzed each option systematically
- ✅ Answer is option NUMBER (5), not the value ("Cabbage, corn, beans")
- ✅ Complete reasoning process shown
- ✅ Perfect score: both answer and format correct

## Implementation Details

### Choice Dependency Logic
```python
if answer_type == "Multiple_Choice":
    is_standalone = "standalone" in problem_type
    if is_standalone:
        # Solvable without seeing options
        prompt_text = f"{problem}\n\nProvide your answer inside \\boxed{{}}."
        expected_answer = answer_value  # e.g., "11"
    else:
        # Requires seeing options
        prompt_text = f"{problem}\n\n{choices}\n\nProvide the number of the correct option (1-5) inside \\boxed{{}}."
        expected_answer = correct_option  # e.g., "3"
```

### Image Encoding
```python
def pil_image_to_base64(pil_img: Image.Image) -> str:
    buffer = BytesIO()
    if pil_img.mode not in ('RGB', 'L'):
        pil_img = pil_img.convert('RGB')
    pil_img.save(buffer, format="PNG")
    return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode('utf-8')
```
