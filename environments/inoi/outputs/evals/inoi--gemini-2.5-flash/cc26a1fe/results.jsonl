(C \u21d2 B)\n2.  **Rule 2 (R2):** He does not plant Cabbage (K) in two consecutive years.

(|Y_n \u2229 Y_{n+1}| \u2264 1)\n\nGiven:\n**Year 1 (Y1): {Beans, Corn, Cabbage} = {B, C, K}**\n\nLet's determine the crops for Year 2 (Y2).\n\n**Step 1: Determine Y2**\nFrom Y1 = {B, C, K}:\n*   Check R1 for Y1: C is planted, and B is planted. (Satisfied)\n*   From R2: Since K is in Y1, K cannot be in Y2.\n    So, the possible crops for Y2 are from {B, C, Z, P}.\n*   From R3: |Y1 \u2229 Y2| \u2264 1.\n\nLet's consider the possible shared crops between Y1 and Y2:\n*   Can Y2 share 0 crops with Y1?\n    Crops not in Y1 are {Z, P}. We need 3 crops for Y2. This is impossible. So, Y2 must share at least one crop.\n*   Can Y2 share 1 crop with Y1?\n    The shared crop can be B or C (since K is excluded from Y2).\n    *   **Case A: Y2 shares B with Y1.**\n        *   So, B is in Y2.\n        *   To satisfy R3 (|Y1 \u2229 Y2| \u2264 1), C cannot be in Y2 (because if C were also in Y2, then {B, C} would be shared, making the intersection size 2).\n        *   K is already excluded from Y2. C is now excluded. So, the remaining crops for Y2 must come from {Z, P}.\n        *   Thus, Y2 = {B, Z, P}.\n        *   Let's check if Y2 = {B, Z, P} is valid:\n            *   3 crops are planted. (OK)\n            *   R1 (C \u21d2 B): C is not in Y2. (Satisfied, rule not triggered)\n            *   R2 (no K in Y2): K is not in Y2.

(Satisfied)\n        *   This is a valid combination for Y2.\n    *   **Case B: Y2 shares C with Y1.**\n        *   So, C is in Y2.\n        *   From R1 (C \u21d2 B), if C is in Y2, then B must also be in Y2.\n        *   This means Y2 contains both B and C.\n        *   Then, |Y1 \u2229 Y2| = |{B, C, K} \u2229 {B, C, ...}| = {B, C}. The size is 2.\n        *   This violates R3 (|Y1 \u2229 Y2| \u2264 1). So, this case is not possible.\n*   Y2 cannot share more than 1 crop with Y1 due to R3.\n\nTherefore, **Y2 must be {Beans, Zucchini, Peas} = {B, Z, P}**. This is uniquely determined.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Y3**\nNow we need to find Y3 based on Y2 = {B, Z, P} and the rules.\n*   From Y2 = {B, Z, P}.\n*   R1: If C, then B.\n*   R2: K was not in Y2, so K *can* be in Y3. (This means no restriction on K for Y3 based on R2).\n*   R3: |Y2 \u2229 Y3| \u2264 1.\n\nLet's check each option for Y3:\n\n*   **Option 1: {Peas, Corn, Beans} = {P, C, B}**\n    *   R1: C is in Y3, B is in Y3. (Satisfied)\n    *   R2: K is not in Y3. (Satisfied)\n    *   R3: Y2 = {B, Z, P}, Y3 = {P, C, B}. The intersection is {B, P}. Its size is 2.

K was not in Y2. (Satisfied)\n    *   R3: Y2 = {B, Z, P}, Y3 = {Z, P, K}. The intersection is {Z, P}. Its size is 2.
