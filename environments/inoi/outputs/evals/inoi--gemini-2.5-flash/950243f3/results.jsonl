The key rules are:\n1.  All rails are one-way from left to right.\n2.  Trains can wait on the track.\n3.  Trains cannot pass each other. This means that if train A enters a particular track (say, Top) and then train B enters the *same* track (Top), train B cannot exit the Top track before train A. This implies that each track acts as a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue for trains that enter it.\n4.  Both rails are long enough to hold any number of trains.\n\nWe need to find which of the given departure orders is NOT possible.\n\nLet's denote the arrival order of trains by their number: Train 5 arrives first, then 4, then 3, then 2, then 1.\nLet `pos_in(X)` be the arrival position of train X. So `pos_in(5)=1`, `pos_in(4)=2`, `pos_in(3)=3`, `pos_in(2)=4`, `pos_in(1)=5`.\n\nThe core logic to determine possibility:\nIf two trains, say `X` and `Y`, appear in the output sequence in the order `..., X, ..., Y, ...` (i.e., `X` departs before `Y`), but `Y` arrived before `X` in the input (i.e., `pos_in(Y) < pos_in(X)`), then `X` and `Y` *must* have taken different tracks. If they took the same track, `Y` would be ahead of `X` and would have to depart before `X`, which contradicts the output order.\nLet `T(X)` denote the track chosen by train `X`. So, if `X` departs before `Y` in the output and `Y` arrived before `X` in the input, then `T(X) != T(Y)`.\n\nWe will identify these \"reversed pairs\" for each option and derive constraints on track assignments. If these constraints lead to a logical contradiction, the option is impossible.

Then `T(1)=T(2)=T(3)=Bottom`.\nFrom (4): `T(1) != T(4)`.

(OK)\nThis order is **possible**.\n\nWe have found two options that are NOT possible: Option 2 and Option 4. Both lead to a logical contradiction in assigning tracks based on the \"cannot pass each other\" rule. This suggests the question might be flawed as it asks for *the* departure order (implying only one). However, in multiple-choice questions where such a situation arises, one typically selects the first impossibility found, or the one with the most direct contradiction.

This indicates that the calculated critical path is robust.\n\nThe only way to reach $T_{min}(C9)=4$ is if one of the dependencies forming the critical path (C1->C3->C6->C8->C9 or C2->C4->C6->C8->C9) is \"broken\" or if a course like C8 became available earlier.\nFor instance, if C8 did not require C6, then $T_{min}(C8)$ could be 1.
