Bethesda advertised that the edition would include a [canvas](canvas) [bag](duffel)(duffel bag), but a [nylon](nylon) one was included instead. Responding to customer complaints, Bethesda claimed that the bag had to be changed due to unavailability of materials, and initially stated the intention to take no action. The publisher received criticism for not making the change known beforehand, with *[Eurogamer](Eurogamer)* pointing out that the bag's description on Bethesda's website had only changed to read \"nylon\" after complaints had been submitted. Bethesda later offered affected customers free in-game currency of 500 atoms as compensation, equivalent to . Critics pointed out this amount of currency was not enough to purchase the in-game postman uniform (700 atoms), which includes a canvas bag. Additionally, it was discovered that Bethesda had produced a different *Fallout 76*\u2013themed canvas bag and given them for free to [influencers](online)(Internet celebrity), further adding to the fan outrage.

Users were able to open and close tickets of other customers and view personal information, including names, addresses, emails and partial credit card information. In a statement given to *[Technica](Ars)(Ars Technica)*, Bethesda said that the breach occurred via \"an error with our customer support website\" and that they are \"investigating the incident and will provide additional updates as we learn more\". The publisher clarified that the only information leaked were details that the support site would have requested, rather than credit card numbers or passwords, and that they would notify all affected customers.\n\nIn 2018, Bethesda partnered with the Silver Screen Bottling Company to create \"Nuka Dark Rum\", an alcoholic beverage based on the in-game \"Nuka-Cola Dark\" introduced in the *[4: Nuka-World](Fallout)(Fallout 4: Nuka-World)* [add-on](Downloadable content). The rum was available to be pre-ordered in August 2018 for . While its release was expected to coincide with the launch of *Fallout 76*, the rum was delayed and was shipped instead in late December 2018. Upon receiving it, fans criticized the fact that the rum bottle advertised, previously expected to be a bottle in the missile-like shape of the in-game Nuka-Cola item, had turned out to be a standard glass bottle encased in a large plastic cover. The rum's asking price of $80 was subsequently condemned from expectations that the design would be of high quality, since none of the marketing had stated what the bottles would be made of.\n\nIn September 2019, collectible \"Nuka Cola\"\u2013themed *Fallout* helmets produced by Chronicle Collectibles, of which only 32 of the 20,000 manufactured were sold, were recalled by the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](U.S.)(U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission) due to containing high levels of mold and posing a health risk. No incidents or injuries were reported. [GameStop](GameStop), which sold the helmets, notified all customers who had purchased a helmet and offered them a full refund.\n\nIn June 2022, a *Kotaku* article published reports from ten anonymous former employees of Bethesda and its parent company [Media](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Media) of severe mismanagement during *Fallout 76*s development. The reports claimed that [crunch](Crunch (video games)) had been enforced, leading to an \"exodus\" of senior developers from the company. The loss of staff led to Bethesda borrowing developers working on [Studios](Arkane)(Arkane Studios)' *[Redfall](Redfall)* and Bethesda's *[Starfield](Starfield (video game))* to assist with *Fallout 76*. Other alleged issues included technical problems with the game's design and engine, as well as these concerns being ignored by senior management.

For example, \"Cassilda's Song\" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:\"The King in Yellow\" in e.g.\n\nThe short story \"The Mask\" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:\"The Mask\" in e.g.\n\nIt is also stated, in \"The Repairer of Reputations\", that the final moment of the first act involves the character Camilla's \"agonized scream and [...] awful words echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa\".\n\nAll of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the \"irresistible\" revealed truths: \"The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect\". Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: \"If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it\" (\"[Repairer of Reputations](The)(The Repairer of Reputations)\").\n\nChambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from \"The Repairer of Reputations\":\n\nHe mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades.

This block of adult cartoons became a staple of the network airing under the brand *[Domination](Animation)(Animation Domination)* from May 1, 2005, to September 14, 2014, when the network rebranded the block as *Sunday Funday* as a result of the re-incorporation of live-action comedy series on the Sunday night lineup after ten years (aside from occasional burn-offs of series aired on other nights during the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern\/Pacific hour), although animated series remain an integral part of that night's schedule.\n\nThe first programs to air as part of the *Animation Domination* lineup were *[Dad!](American)(American Dad!)* (which also had its beginnings in the lineup, and moved to [TBS](TBS (American TV channel)) in October 2014), *[Guy](Family)(Family Guy)* (which returned to the network after a three-year cancellation when *Animation Domination* began), *[Simpsons](The)(The Simpsons)* (the longest-running cartoon on Fox, predating the lineup by 16 years), and *[of the Hill](King)(King of the Hill)* (which also predated the lineup by eight years).

Before meeting Edward, Martin reveals to the warden, Moss, that he was brought in to fill in for Dr. Stewart, who was Edward's regular visitor for this procedure. Stewart had died by suicide the night before, causing Martin to replace him. Edward is scheduled to die via electrocution at his insistence that very day and Moss explains to Martin that Edward's fate depends upon Martin's diagnosis; if Martin deduces that Edward is sane, he will be executed, but if Martin declares him insane with multi-personality disorder as Stewart had believed, Edward will be spared.\n\nWhen Martin takes a seat to interrogate Edward, the inmate refuses to be identified as a human and instead a demon inhabiting Edward's body named \"Nefariamous,\" a name Satan gave him  \"Nefarious\" for short. Martin does not believe Nefarious is who he says he is and thinks instead that it is an act by Edward to seem insane; however, he is surprised when Nefarious insists that he wants to be executed, or rather, that he wants Edward to be executed. Nefarious also explains that before the day is over, Martin will commit three murders.\n\nMartin, an atheist, balks at this idea but plays along, asking Nefarious how he came to inhabit Edward. Nefarious explains that he possessed Edward through a process carried out through Edward\u2019s life, beginning with ease of access through Edward\u2019s never having been [baptized](baptized), continuing through seemingly innocuous events such as Edward\u2019s grandmother having given him a [board](ouija)(ouija board) as a present, allowing manipulative communication, finally completing the process only after Edward consented to the possession multiple times. Martin brings in a chaplain to confront the demon in Edward, which frightens Nefarious until he realizes that the priest does not believe in demons and therefore has no effect on him. Martin then asks to talk to Edward, causing Nefarious to recede and produce a timid, childlike Edward who is terribly distraught and shaken by his possession. Edward insists that he is possessed and that the demon had murdered multiple people using his innocent body as a vessel.\n\nWhen Martin begins probing further, Nefarious takes control and insists that Martin euthanized his terminally ill mother to acquire her massive wealth. Martin becomes angry and threatens to leave the meeting, but changes his mind. When Martin decides to write Nefarious off as insane, Nefarious explains that Martin's girlfriend is pregnant, and because Martin threatened to leave her, she is terminating her pregnancy. Overcome with curiosity, Martin begs a kindly prison guard for access to a phone, which he uses to call the health clinic from where he realizes his girlfriend has just finished with the abortion. Nefarious cackles with glee, explaining to Martin that \"all hell is rejoicing.\"\n\nMartin still remains doubtful Nefarious is possessed, but is fully intrigued to hear what the inmate has to tell him. After Martin insists that the world is reclaiming the moral high ground, Nefarious laughs before telling him there is currently an influx of slavery and human trafficking which the demons are helping with. Nefarious then explains he wants Martin to write a book called *The Dark Gospel*, which is his Satanic equivalent to the Bible and will begin another world religion in servitude to demons. Martin is called away by Warden Moss who reveals to him that upon searching Edward's prison cell, they found documentation of Martin's life as Nefarious had done with all his other victims, as well as the dark gospel which Edward wrote, crediting it to Martin's name. Martin, now believing Edward is faking split personalities, confronts Nefarious about this. Nefarious breaks his own hand to slip free of one of the cuffs and seizes Martin, threatening to break his neck unless Martin begs for his life. Overcome with terror, Martin begs Nefarious to spare him to which Nefarious complies before being beaten down by the prison guards. Instinctively, Martin declares that Edward is sane, but not before being warned by a triumphant Nefarious that he is condemning Edward to death.\n\nAs Edward is in the electric chair, Nefarious possesses his body for a final time, asking if Martin accepts his offer, to which Martin silently refuses. Disappointed, Nefarious leaves Edward's body, causing Edward to suffer an extremely painful and terrible death in the chair. The demon then tells Martin, \"You should have accepted my offer,\" before possessing him and trying to force Martin to commit suicide. However, Martin inadvertently prays to God for help, causing the gun to misfire and Nefarious to let go of him.

Both Dacus and Bridgers had opened for Baker on separate tours in 2016, and they all ran in similar circles as young up-and-coming performers navigating the [indie](Independent music) scene.\n\nThe three became close and shared their frustrations of constantly being compared to each other as \"[in rock](women)(women in rock)\" despite their considerably different musical styles. Dacus has commented that the idea of women in music \"should not be remarkable whatsoever,\" with Bridgers adding, \"it's not a genre.\" Each has spoken on the tendency of the music industry to pit women against each other, and the group was formed in part to reject this idea. \"I hope people see the three of us and know there isn't competition,\" Dacus has said. \"You don't have to compete with your contemporaries. You can make something good with people you admire.\"\n\nBaker had joked to Dacus years before about a \"pipe dream\" that they could one day all form a band. The three decided to book a [tour](co-headlining)(Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers with Lucy Dacus Tour) in early 2018, and they originally planned to record a single or a [version](cover)(cover version) so that they could perform something together on stage. Upon meeting up that summer, however, they found themselves overwhelmed with ideas, and they ended up forming the band, writing, recording, and self-producing the *[Boygenius](Boygenius (EP))* [EP](Extended play) in four days, with the process involving almost exclusively women.\n\nEach brought one full song and one incomplete idea with them to the group. They sought to create an environment free of the competitiveness and \"bravado\" they had often encountered in previous experiences, and they have remarked that the absence of adult men in the process proved significant, allowing them to relate to each other openly without constantly having to explain themselves. The record was met with universal acclaim from critics and audiences alike; it was named the 12th best album of 2018 by [Music](NPR)(NPR Music), despite being only an [EP](Extended play).

At this time, Microsoft was facing strong competition in the consumer market, and within the gaming sector, the Xbox One (released in 2013) was more expensive than competitors and had too much focus on non-gaming functions. Under Nadella's direction, Phil Spencer was named the new head of Microsoft Studios to replace Jason Holtman, who had only been its lead for the prior six months. Spencer began looking for ways to expand Microsoft Studios to make it a profitable division for Microsoft, and began negotiations for the acquititions of [Mojang](Mojang), the developers behind *[Minecraft](Minecraft)*, in late 2014. Microsoft spent  to acquire the studio, and upon the deal's completion in November, the studio's key founding personnel, [Persson](Markus)(Markus Persson), Jakob Pors\u00e9r and Carl Manneh, departed Mojang. As a result, Persson became valued around . Microsoft Studios committed to keeping *Minecraft* available across multiple platforms, including rival PlayStation consoles. Matt Booty, the studio's corporate vice-president in 2020, said the acquisition of Mojang served as the template for later acquisitions, as Mojang was left to run as an \"unplugged studio\" with limited integration into the Microsoft corporation, minimizing the disruption of Mojang's normal day-to-day business matters nor impeding on the studio's freedom.\n\nAdditional [property](intellectual)(intellectual property) (IP) acquisitions by Microsoft Studios in 2014 included a publishing contract with [Labs](Undead)(Undead Labs) for their game *[of Decay](State)(State of Decay (video game))*, the rights to the *[of War](Gears)(Gears of War)* series from [Games](Epic)(Epic Games), and the *Rise of* IP (*[of Nations](Rise)(Rise of Nations)* and *[of Nations: Rise of Legends](Rise)(Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends)*) from [Huge Games](Big)(Big Huge Games). Microsoft Studios assigned *Gears of War* to Black Tusk Studios, which was later rebranded in 2015 as The Coalition.\n\nIn July 2014, it was announced that [Entertainment Studios](Xbox)(Xbox Entertainment Studios) would be closed in the following months; the closure was completed by October 29. On March 4, 2015, Microsoft announced that they were merging UK-based studios, Lift London and Soho Productions for further games development, with the amalgam continuing to operate under the Lift London name. On March 7, Microsoft announced at the [Developers Conference](Game)(Game Developers Conference) that [HoloLens](HoloLens) games were coming to Xbox One. On March 9, Microsoft announced that Kudo Tsunoda's role was expanding and that he would be the new studio team leader for studios such as Press Play, Lift London and a new internal studio called Decisive Games. Decisive Games was previously mentioned in job postings, saying that they were hiring for work on a \"beloved strategy game\" for Xbox One and PC, but this is the first public acknowledgement of the team's existence as a first-party studio. Twisted Pixel and Microsoft Studios agreed to split in September 2015.\n\nKudo Tsunoda left the Xbox division in November 2015 for the development of HoloLens and [Edge](Microsoft)(Microsoft Edge), and other projects that could improve means of human interaction, including voice and gesture. Tsunoda's role was filled by Hanno Lemke and Shannon Loftis. In 2016, Microsoft was perceived as \"unifying PC and Xbox One\" platforms. In March 2016, Microsoft canceled development of two major projects: Lionhead's *[Legends](Fable)(Fable Legends)* and Press Play's *[Knoxville](Project)(Knoxville (video game))*, shuttering both studios in the following months. Around the same time, changes to Microsoft Studios' website indicated that further studios\u2014BigPark, [Science Studio](Good)(Good Science Studio), Leap Experience Pioneers (LXP), Function Studios and State of the Art (SOTA)\u2014had been closed, Microsoft Studios clarified that all of them had been consolidated into other Microsoft Studios teams over the past several years.\n\nIn September 2017, Spencer was promoted to the senior leadership team, gaining the title of \"executive vice-president of gaming\". At this point, Microsoft Studios directly reported to Nadella. In January 2018, Matt Booty was promoted from leader in the *Minecraft* games business to corporate vice-president of Microsoft Studios. On June 10, 2018, during the [Entertainment Expo 2018](Electronic)(Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018), Microsoft announced the acquisitions of [Theory](Ninja)(Ninja Theory), [Games](Playground)(Playground Games), [Labs](Undead)(Undead Labs) and [Games](Compulsion)(Compulsion Games), as well as the opening of a new studio in [Monica, California](Santa)(Santa Monica, California), entitled The Initiative, which would be led by the former [Dynamics](Crystal)(Crystal Dynamics) studio head Darrell Gallagher. In November, Microsoft Studios announced further acquisitions with [Entertainment](Obsidian)(Obsidian Entertainment) and [Entertainment](inXile)(inXile Entertainment).\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-ec5102ff7fa045f693d0413cbc4f194c\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"xbox_game_studios:as_xbox_game_studios_(2019\\u2013present)\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"### As Xbox Game Studios (2019\u2013present)\n\nThe studio rebranded itself on February 5, 2019, as Xbox Game Studios, as to reflect Microsoft's intent to use the Xbox brand to support gaming across all the devices it supports. At [2019](E3)(E3 2019), Xbox Game Studios announced it had acquired [Fine](Double)(Double Fine), and established a new internal studio dedicated to *Age of Empires* headed by Shannon Loftis, bringing their total studio count to fifteen. This studio, later named World's Edge, does not directly develop any games, but oversees efforts from external studios, such as [Entertainment](Relic)(Relic Entertainment), Forgotten Empires and [Media](Tantalus)(Tantalus Media), to assure the series is being developed in the right direction, according to creative director Adam Isgreen.\n\nBooty has stated that with studios like Obsidian, Ninja Theory, and Double Fine, which have traditionally supported multiplatform games, they will determine if it makes sense for their future products to be treated as Microsoft-exclusive content for Xbox and Windows computers, or to allow these to be published across multiple platforms. That decision will be based on a \"network effect\", whether having these games on other platforms will better support the franchise and thus worthwhile for Microsoft to help dedicate resources towards it, such as they had with *Minecraft*. Xbox Game Studios has allowed some of the content developed by its studios or that was previously published exclusively for the Xbox and Windows systems to be released on [Nintendo](Nintendo) systems, notably the [Switch](Nintendo)(Nintendo Switch) versions of *[Cuphead](Cuphead)* from Studio MDHR and *[and the Blind Forest](Ori)(Ori and the Blind Forest)* from Moon Studios, and allowing for the titular characters from Rare's *[Banjo-Kazooie](Banjo-Kazooie)* into *[Smash Bros. Ultimate](Super)(Super Smash Bros. Ultimate)*. However, the division stated that these releases were generally \"existing commitments to other platforms\" that they allowed studios to honor, but they otherwise have \"no plans to further expand our exclusive first party games to other consoles.\"\n\nNear the end of 2019, with the combined fifteen studios now under Xbox Game Studios, Booty stated that they now had more games than ever to handle, and were likely not going to acquire any additional studios in the near future, stating \"we've been shifting our focus inside Xbox Game Studios from acquisition and growth, to a phase of execution and delivery\". Additionally, as Microsoft started promotion of its fourth-generation of Xbox, including the [Series X](Xbox)(Xbox Series X), Booty stated that titles developed by Xbox Game Studios in year or two following its release will not be exclusively for the new generation of consoles, but instead will support both Xbox One and the new console, with some games receiving enhanced performance when played on the new console lineup. Booty said that with the large number of studios they had recently acquired, as well as ongoing external partnerships and their [Game Pass](Xbox)(Xbox Game Pass) service, the Studios are able to support a \"breadth of offerings in the portfolio\" designed to attract a large number of players. Further, in an interview in November 2020, Phil Spencer said during an interview regarding the future of the Xbox brand that he intends to put more focus on outputting [RPG](Role-playing video game)s, which had to that point been underserved.\n\nMicrosoft and [Media](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Media) announced on September 21, 2020, that Microsoft planned to acquire ZeniMax and its family of studios, which include [Game Studios](Bethesda)(Bethesda Game Studios), [Studios](Arkane)(Arkane Studios), [Software](id)(id Software), [MachineGames](MachineGames), [Gameworks](Tango)(Tango Gameworks), and [Online Studios](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Online Studios), for over  in cash. According to Spencer, the ZeniMax acquisition was intended to give Microsoft a large library of games known around the world, and to expand the library of Xbox Game Pass and [XCloud](XCloud). Both U.S. and European Union regulatory agencies approved the acquisition by early March 2021, and the acquisition was formally completed by March 9, 2021. The total price of the deal was $8.1 billion Bethesda Softworks, the primarily publisher for all of ZeniMax's games, remained as an operational unit under Microsoft with the acquisition and retained all its current leadership. With the acquisition, future games from the studios will be exclusive to Xbox consoles, but existing commitments to other platforms (such as Arkane Studios' *[Deathloop](Deathloop)* and Tango Gameworks' *[Tokyo](Ghostwire:)(Ghostwire: Tokyo)*, which are contractually exclusive to [5](PlayStation)(PlayStation 5)) will still be honored. Spencer stated that Game Pass was also fundamental driver for the acquisition. A preliminary injunction to block the acquisition had been sought in an ongoing class-action lawsuit that ZeniMax faced over *[4](Fallout)(Fallout 4)*, with the plaintiffs in the case arguing that Microsoft could shield ZeniMax's assets from damages should they be found liable after the acquisition. The ZeniMax Board of Directors was dissolved following the Microsoft purchase.\n\nOn January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire [Blizzard](Activision)(Activision Blizzard) in an all-cash deal valued at $68.7 billion. Microsoft stated that this acquisition would make it the third-largest gaming company by revenue, following [Tencent](Tencent) and [Sony](Sony).

McMahon](Vincent)(Vincent J. McMahon), when 12. At that point, McMahon became interested in following his father's professional wrestling footsteps and often accompanied him on trips to [Square Garden](Madison)(Madison Square Garden). McMahon wanted to be a wrestler, but his father did not allow him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers.\n\nIn 1968, McMahon graduated from [Carolina University](East)(East Carolina University) with a business degree and after a nondescript career as a traveling salesman, he was eager to assume a managerial role in his father's [Wide Wrestling Federation](World)(WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation) promotion. In 1969, McMahon made his debut as a ring announcer for the WWWF's *[Wrestling](All-Star)(List of former WWE programming#All-Star Wrestling (1971\u20131986))*. In 1971, he was assigned to a small territory in Maine, where he promoted his first card. He later became the play-by-play commentator for television matches after replacing [Morgan](Ray)(Ray Morgan (announcer)) in 1971, a role he regularly maintained until November 1997.\n\nIn the 1970s, McMahon became a prominent force in his father's company and, over the next decade, assisted his father in tripling TV syndication. The younger McMahon was also behind the [Ali](Muhammad)(Muhammad Ali) versus [Inoki](Antonio)(Antonio Inoki) match of 1976. He pushed for the renaming of the company to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979.\n\nOn February 21, 1980, McMahon officially founded Titan Sports and the company's headquarters were established in [Yarmouth, Massachusetts](South)(South Yarmouth, Massachusetts), using the now-defunct [Cod Coliseum](Cape)(Cape Cod Coliseum) as a home base for the company. McMahon then became chairman of the company and his wife, Linda, became the \"co-chief executive\".

It stands on a platform or [stylobate](stylobate) of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of [and lintel](post)(post and lintel) construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an [entablature](entablature). There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and seventeen on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the *[cella](cella),* which is divided into two compartments. The *[opisthodomos](opisthodomos)* (the back room of the cella) contained the monetary contributions of the Delian League. At either end of the building, the [gable](gable) is finished with a triangular [pediment](pediment) originally occupied by sculpted figures.\n\nThe Parthenon has been described as \"the culmination of the development of the Doric order.\"\"Parthenon.\" *Britannica Library*, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 10 September 2021. Accessed 16 July 2022. The Doric columns, for example, have simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a [frieze](frieze) of carved pictorial panels ([metopes](Metope (architecture))), separated by formal architectural [triglyph](triglyph)s, also typical of the Doric order. The continuous [frieze](frieze) in low relief around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns, in contrast, reflects the Ionic order. Architectural historian John R. Senseney suggests that this unexpected switch between orders was due to an aesthetic choice on the part of builders during construction, and was likely not part of the original plan of the Parthenon.\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are . The cella was 29.8&nbsp;metres long by 19.2&nbsp;metres wide (97.8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;63.0&nbsp;ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure  in diameter and are  high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column having 20 flutes. (A flute is the [concave](wikt:concave) shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as [and tegulae](imbrices)(imbrex and tegula).\n\nThe Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. [Julius Cooper](John)(John Julius Cooper) wrote that \"even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [naos](naos (architecture)) walls, and the [entasis](entasis) of the columns.\"John Julius Norwich, *Great Architecture of the World*, 2001, p. 63 Entasis refers to the slight swelling, of , in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,And in the surviving foundations of the preceding Older Parthenon (Penrose, *Principles of Athenian Architecture* 2nd ed. ch. II.3, plate 9). it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outward, but they actually lean slightly inward so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly  above the centre of the Parthenon. Since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [architrave](architrave) and roof above: \"All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves\", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.Penrose *op. cit.* pp. 32\u201334, found the difference motivated by economies of labour; Gorham P. Stevens, \"Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon\" *American Journal of Archaeology* **66**.3 (July 1962:337\u2013338).\n\n[[East Facade pf the Parthenon on March 22, 2021.jpg|thumb|left|The east facade|upright=1.2](File:The)]\n\nIt is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these \"optical refinements\" was. They may serve as a sort of \"reverse optical illusion.\"Archaeologists discuss similarly curved architecture and offer the theory. *Nova*, \"Secrets of the Parthenon,\" PBS. http:\/\/video.yahoo.com\/watch\/1849622\/6070405 As the Greeks may have been aware, two [parallel](parallel (geometry)) lines appear to bow, or curve outward, when intersected by converging lines. In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves. But the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.\n\nSome studies of the Acropolis, including of the Parthenon and its facade, have conjectured that many of its proportions approximate the [ratio](golden)(golden ratio).Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., \"Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis,\" *Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly*, Vol. 46, 1998. More recent studies have shown that the proportions of the Parthenon do not match the golden proportion.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The two architects responsible for the design of the Parthenon were **Ictinus** and **Callicrates**.

For example, \"Cassilda's Song\" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:\"The King in Yellow\" in e.g.\n\nThe short story \"The Mask\" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:\"The Mask\" in e.g.\n\nIt is also stated, in \"The Repairer of Reputations\", that the final moment of the first act involves the character Camilla's \"agonized scream and [...] awful words echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa\".\n\nAll of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the \"irresistible\" revealed truths: \"The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect\". Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: \"If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it\" (\"[Repairer of Reputations](The)(The Repairer of Reputations)\").\n\nChambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from \"The Repairer of Reputations\":\n\nHe mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. \"The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever\", he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.\n\nA similar passage occurs in \"The Yellow Sign\", in which two protagonists have read *The King in Yellow*:\n\nNight fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The fictional play within *The King in Yellow* is titled **\"The King in Yellow\"**.

Unlike [liner](ocean)(ocean liner)s, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports-of-call, where passengers may go on [tours](Tourism) known as \"shore excursions\". They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by the [tonnage](gross)(gross tonnage)(GT), bigger than many [ships](cargo)(List of largest container ships). Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s; before then, few were more than 50,000GT. In the decades since, the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled. There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000GT or greater. In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). , the largest cruise ship, , has a gross tonnage of 236,857, is  long,  wide, and holds up to 6,988 passengers.\n\nCruise ships are organized much like floating hotels, with a complete hospitality staff in addition to the usual ship's crew. Modern cruise ships, while sacrificing some qualities of [seaworthiness](seakeeping), have added amenities to cater to [tourists](nautical)(nautical tourism), with recent vessels being described as \"balcony-laden floating condominiums\". The \"megaships\" went from a single deck with verandas to all decks with verandas, and feature ameneties such as theaters, fine-dining and chain restaurants, spas, fitness centers, casinos, sports facilities, and even amusement park attractions.\n\nCruise ships require electricity for powering both hotel services and for [propulsion](Marine propulsion). Cruise ships are designed with all the heavy machinery at the bottom of the ship and lightweight materials at the top, making them inherently stable even as ship designs are getting taller and taller, and most passenger ships utilize [fins](stabilizer)(Stabilizer (ship)) to further reduce rolling of tall ships in heavy weather. While some cruise ships use traditional fixed [propeller](propeller)s and [rudder](rudder)s to steer, most larger ships use propellers that can swivel left and right to steer the ship, known as [thruster](azimuth)(azimuth thruster)s, which allow even the largest ship designs to have adequate maneuverability.\n\nCruise ships are operated by [line](cruise)(cruise line)s, which are [companies](company) that market cruises to the public. In the 1990s, many cruise lines were bought by much larger holding companies and continue to operate as brands or subsidiaries of the holding company. For instance, [Corporation & plc](Carnival)(Carnival Corporation & plc) owns both the [mass-market](Mass market) [Cruise Line](Carnival)(Carnival Cruise Line), focused on larger party ships for younger travelers, and [America Line](Holland)(Holland America Line), whose smaller ships cultivate an image of classic elegance. The common practice in the cruise industry in ship sales and orders is to list the smaller operating company, not the larger holding corporation, as the recipient cruise line of the ship.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"As of 2023, the largest cruise ship is the **Wonder of the Seas**, operated by Royal Caribbean International.

I did not concern myself with music at all.\"Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 55. He wrote that contact with Balakirev in September 1865 encouraged him \"to get accustomed to music and later to plunge into it\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 56. At Balakirev's suggestion, he wrote a trio to the [scherzo](scherzo) of the E-flat minor symphony, which it had lacked up to that point, and reorchestrated the entire symphony.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, pp. 58\u201359. Its first performance came in December of that year under Balakirev's direction in Saint Petersburg.Abraham, *New Grove (1980)*, 16:28. A second performance followed in March 1866 under the direction of Konstantin Lyadov (father of composer [Lyadov](Anatoly)(Anatoly Lyadov)).\n\nCorrespondence between Rimsky-Korsakov and Balakirev clearly shows that some ideas for the symphony originated with Balakirev, who seldom stopped at merely correcting a piece of music, and would often recompose it at the piano. Rimsky-Korsakov recalled,\n\nA pupil like myself had to submit to Balakirev a proposed composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try hard to make the author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended over a long period of time under the cold control of self-criticism.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 29.\n\n[[File:Balakirev from 1914 Windsor Magazine.png|thumb|upright|alt=A man in his late 20s or early 30s with dark hair and a bushy beard, wearing a dark coat, dress shirt and tie|[Balakirev](Mily)(Mily Balakirev) encouraged Rimsky-Korsakov to continue composing.]]\n\nRimsky-Korsakov recalled that \"Balakirev had no difficulty in getting along with me. At his suggestion I most readily rewrote the symphonic movements composed by me and brought them to completion with the help of his advice and improvisations\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 30. Though Rimsky-Korsakov later found Balakirev's influence stifling, and broke free from it,Maes, p. 44. this did not stop him in his memoirs from extolling the older composer's talents as a critic and improviser. Under Balakirev's mentoring, Rimsky-Korsakov turned to other compositions. He began a symphony in B minor, but felt it too closely followed [Beethoven](Ludwig van Beethoven)'s [Symphony](Ninth)(Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)) and abandoned it. He completed an Overture on Three Russian Themes, based on Balakirev's folksong overtures, as well as a [on Serbian Themes](Fantasia)(Fantasy on Serbian Themes) that was performed at a concert given for the delegates of the [Congress](Slavonic)(Pan-Slavism) in 1867. In his review of this concert, nationalist critic [Stasov](Vladimir)(Vladimir Stasov) coined the phrase *Moguchaya kuchka* for the Balakirev circle (*Moguchaya kuchka* is usually translated as \"The Mighty Handful\" or \"The Five\"). Rimsky-Korsakov also composed the initial versions of *Sadko* and *[Antar](Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov))*, which cemented his reputation as a writer of orchestral works.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov socialized and discussed music with the other members of The Five; they critiqued one another's works in progress and collaborated on new pieces. He became friends with [Borodin](Alexander)(Alexander Borodin), whose music \"astonished\" him.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 57. He spent an increasing amount of time with Mussorgsky. Balakirev and Mussorgsky played piano four-hand music, Mussorgsky would sing, and they frequently discussed other composers' works, with preferred tastes running \"toward Glinka, Schumann and Beethoven's late quartets\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 21. [Mendelssohn](Felix Mendelssohn) was not thought of highly, [Mozart](Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) and [Haydn](Joseph Haydn) \"were considered out of date and na\u00efve\", and [Bach](J.S.)(Johann Sebastian Bach) merely mathematical and unfeeling. Berlioz \"was highly esteemed\", Liszt \"crippled and perverted from a musical point of view&nbsp;... even a caricature\", and Wagner discussed little. Rimsky-Korsakov \"listened to these opinions with avidity and absorbed the tastes of Balakirev, Cui and Mussorgsky without reasoning or examination\". Often, the musical works in question \"were played before me only in fragments, and I had no idea of the whole work\". This, he wrote, did not stop him from accepting these judgments at face value and repeating them \"as if I were thoroughly convinced of their truth\".\n\nRimsky-Korsakov became especially appreciated within The Five, and among those who visited the circle, for his talents as an orchestrator. He was asked by Balakirev to orchestrate a [Schubert](Franz Schubert) march for a concert in May 1868, by Cui to orchestrate the opening chorus of his opera *[Ratcliff](William)(William Ratcliff (Cui))* and by [Dargomyzhsky](Alexander)(Alexander Dargomyzhsky), whose works were greatly appreciated by The Five and who was close to death, to orchestrate his opera *[Stone Guest](The)(The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky))*.\n\nIn late 1871, Rimsky-Korsakov moved into Voin's former apartment, and invited Mussorgsky to be his roommate. The working arrangement they agreed upon was that Mussorgsky used the piano in the mornings while Rimsky-Korsakov worked on copying or orchestration. When Mussorgsky left for his civil service job at noon, Rimsky-Korsakov then used the piano. Time in the evenings was allotted by mutual agreement. \"That autumn and winter the two of us accomplished a good deal\", Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, \"with constant exchange of ideas and plans. Mussorgsky composed and orchestrated the Polish act of *[Godunov](Boris)(Boris Godunov (opera))* and the folk scene 'Near Kromy.' I orchestrated and finished my *[of Pskov](Maid)(The Maid of Pskov)*.\"Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 123.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-75d4a095362040dfa8703a33f5711a64\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\": \\\"nikolai_rimsky-korsakov:orchestral_works\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"### Orchestral works\n\nThe purely orchestral works fall into two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly programmatic in nature \u2014 in other words, the musical content and how it is handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works is more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.\n\n[[File:RimskyScheherezadeThemes.png|thumb|left|alt=Two staves of music, one with a loud, forceful theme and the second with a softer, more undulating theme|Opening themes of the Sultan and [Scheherazade](Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov))]]\n\nProgram music came naturally to Rimsky-Korsakov. To him, \"even a folk theme has a program of sorts.\"Frolova-Walker, *New Grove (2001)*, 21:409. He composed the majority of his orchestral works in this genre at two periods of his career\u2014at the beginning, with *Sadko* and *Antar* (also known as his Second Symphony, Op. 9), and in the 1880s, with *Scheherazade*, *Capriccio Espagnol* and the *Russian Easter Overture*. Despite the gap between these two periods, the composer's overall approach and the way he used his musical themes remained consistent. Both *Antar* and *Scheherazade* use a robust \"Russian\" theme to portray the male protagonists (the title character in *Antar*; the sultan in *Scheherazade*) and a more sinuous \"Eastern\" theme for the female ones (the [peri](peri) Gul-Nazar in *Antar* and the title character in *Scheherazade*).Maes, pp. 82, 175.\n\nWhere Rimsky-Korsakov changed between these two sets of works was in orchestration. While his pieces were always celebrated for their imaginative use of instrumental forces, the sparser textures of *Sadko* and *Antar* pale compared to the luxuriance of the more popular works of the 1880s. While a principle of highlighting \"primary hues\" of instrumental color remained in place, it was augmented in the later works by a sophisticated cachet of orchestral effects, some gleaned from other composers including Wagner, but many invented by himself.\n\nAs a result, these works resemble brightly colored mosaics, striking in their own right and often scored with a juxtaposition of pure orchestral groups. The final *tutti* of *Scheherazade* is a prime example of this scoring. The theme is assigned to trombones playing in unison, and is accompanied by a combination of [string](string instrument) patterns. Meanwhile, another pattern alternates with chromatic scales in the [woodwinds](woodwind instruments) and a third pattern of rhythms is played by percussion.Abraham, *New Grove (1980)*, 16:32\u201333.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov's non-program music, though well-crafted, does not rise to the same level of inspiration as his programmatic works; he needed fantasy to bring out the best in him. The First Symphony follows the outlines of Schumann's Fourth extremely closely, and is slighter in its thematic material than his later compositions. The Third Symphony and Sinfonietta each contain a series of variations on less-than-the-best music that can lead to tedium.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The Russian composer who was a member of the group known as The Five and is famous for the orchestral suite *Scheherazade* is **Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov**.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","generation_ms":27527.5309085846,"scoring_ms":0.009059906,"total_ms":27908.8268280029,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov","reward":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

In 2004, it released the [Portable](PlayStation)(PlayStation Portable) (PSP) to compete with the [DS](Nintendo)(Nintendo DS) as part of the [generation of video game consoles](seventh)(seventh generation of video game consoles). After a slow start in the worldwide market, it was invigorated in Japan with multiple releases in the *[Hunter](Monster)(Monster Hunter)* series. With the series being less popular in western regions, it failed to revive the platform in the same way. The PSP ended up being a mixed result for the company. It was seen as a success in that it was the only handheld video game platform that had ever significantly competed with Nintendo for market share, with almost 80 million units sold in its lifespan, roughly the same amount as Nintendo's [Boy Advance](Game)(Game Boy Advance) had during the [generation of video game consoles](sixth)(sixth generation of video game consoles). This is only a little more than half of the sales of its actual market competitor, the DS, which was more than 150 million units by the end of 2011.\n\nRumors of a successor to the PSP came as early as July 2009 when *[Eurogamer](Eurogamer)* reported that Sony was working on such a device, which would utilize the PowerVR SGX543MP processor and perform at a level similar to the original [Xbox](Xbox (console)). Through mid-2010, websites continued to run stories about accounts of the existence of a \"PSP 2\". Reports arose during the [Game Show](Tokyo)(Tokyo Game Show) that the device was unveiled internally during a private meeting during mid-September held at Sony Computer Entertainment's headquarters in Aoyama, Tokyo. Shortly after, reports of [kits](development)(development kits) for the handheld had reportedly already been shipped to numerous video game developers including both [first-party](SIE Worldwide Studios) and third-party developers to start making games for the device, a report later confirmed by *[Kombat](Mortal)(Mortal Kombat (2011 video game))* Executive Producer Shaun Himmerick. By November, Senior Vice President of [Arts](Electronic)(Electronic Arts), Patrick Soderlund, confirmed that he had seen that the PlayStation Portable successor existed, but could not confirm details. In the same month, [VG247](VG247) released pictures of an early prototype version showing a [Go](PSP)(PSP Go)-like slide-screen design along with two analog sticks, two cameras and a microphone, though the report mentioned that overheating issues had since caused them to move away from the design in favor of a model more similar to the original PlayStation Portable device.\n\nThroughout 2010, Sony would not confirm these reports of a PSP successor but would make comments regarding making future hardware. [Yoshida](Shuhei)(Shuhei Yoshida), President of [Worldwide Studios](SCE)(SCE Worldwide Studios) revealed that his studio, despite usually being more involved with software, had a continued role in future hardware development at the time. In December, [Computer Entertainment](Sony)(Sony Computer Entertainment) CEO [Hirai](Kazuo)(Kazuo Hirai) stated that Sony aimed to appeal to a wide demographic of people by using multiple input methods on future hardware; buttons and joysticks for traditional handheld game system users, and touchscreens for [phone](smart)(smart phone) users. The device was officially announced by Sony on January 27, 2011, at their \"PlayStation Meeting\" press conference held by the company in Japan. The system, only known by its code name \"Next Generation Portable\", was announced to be a handheld gaming device that aimed for [3](PlayStation)(PlayStation 3) quality visuals, which was later clarified to not be taken at a literal level because, according to David Coombes, platform research manager at [Computer Entertainment America](Sony)(Sony Computer Entertainment America), \"Well, it's not going to run at 2&nbsp;GHz [the PS3](like) because the battery would last five minutes and it would probably set fire to your pants\". Its power was later described by Sony engineers as about halfway between the PSP and PS3. As rumors had suggested, the device was designed to present \"the best of both worlds\" between mobile and handheld gaming, including a 5-inch OLED touchscreen, a rear touchpad coupled with physical buttons and dual analog sticks. Sony also revealed that the device would be using a mix of retail and digital distribution of games. Further details were announced at [Developers Conference](Game)(Game Developers Conference) 2011, including that Sony would be dropping the PSP's [UMD](Universal Media Disc) disc format in favor of small game cartridges of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB size variants.  along with two cameras, facial detection, head detection and tracking capabilities.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The codename used for the PlayStation Vita before its official announcement was \"Next Generation Portable.\"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","generation_ms":23915.1849746704,"scoring_ms":0.0100135803,"total_ms":24296.639919281,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Next Generation Portable","reward":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

The Norwegian text translates into \"Applies to all of Svalbard\".](File:Polar-Bear-Warning-Longyearbyen.jpg|thumb|right|Road)]\n\nConcerns over the future survival of the species led to the development of national regulations on polar bear hunting, beginning in the mid-1950s. The Soviet Union banned all hunting in 1956. Canada began imposing hunting quotas in 1968. Norway passed a series of increasingly strict regulations from 1965 to 1973, and has completely banned hunting since then. The United States began regulating hunting in 1971 and adopted the [Mammal Protection Act](Marine)(Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972) in 1972. In 1973, the [Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears](International)(International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears) was signed by all five nations whose territory is inhabited by polar bears: Canada, Denmark, Norway, the [Union](Soviet)(Soviet Union), and the United States. Member countries agreed to place restrictions on recreational and commercial hunting, ban hunting from aircraft and icebreakers, and conduct further research.[International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20030409113042\/http:\/\/pbsg.npolar.no\/ConvAgree\/agreement.htm), 15 November 1973, Oslo The treaty allows hunting \"by local people using traditional methods\". Norway is the only country of the five in which all harvest of polar bears is banned. The agreement was a rare case of international cooperation during the [War](Cold)(Cold War). Biologist [Stirling](Ian)(Ian Stirling (biologist)) commented, \"For many years, the conservation of polar bears was the only subject in the entire Arctic that nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain could agree upon sufficiently to sign an agreement. Such was the intensity of human fascination with this magnificent predator, the only marine bear.\"[Ian](Stirling,)(Ian Stirling (biologist)) *Foreword* in\n\nAgreements have been made between countries to co-manage their shared polar bear subpopulations. After several years of negotiations, Russia and the United States signed an agreement in October 2000 to jointly set quotas for indigenous subsistence hunting in Alaska and [Chukotka](Chukotka Autonomous Okrug). The treaty was ratified in October 2007. In September 2015, the polar bear range states agreed upon a \"circumpolar action plan\" describing their conservation strategy for polar bears.\n\nThe species is listed in Appendix II of the [on International Trade in Endangered Species](Convention)(Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) (CITES) meaning international trade, including in parts or derivatives, is controlled by the CITES system of permits and certificates. The United States government has proposed that polar bears be transferred to Appendix I of [CITES](CITES) which would ban all commercial international trade in polar bear parts. The decision to leave the species listed under Appendix II was endorsed by the IUCN and [TRAFFIC](TRAFFIC), who determined that such an uplisting was unlikely to confer a conservation benefit.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The five nations that are signatories of the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears are:\n\n1.
