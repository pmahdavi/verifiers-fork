Before meeting Edward, Martin reveals to the warden, Moss, that he was brought in to fill in for Dr. Stewart, who was Edward's regular visitor for this procedure. Stewart had died by suicide the night before, causing Martin to replace him. Edward is scheduled to die via electrocution at his insistence that very day and Moss explains to Martin that Edward's fate depends upon Martin's diagnosis; if Martin deduces that Edward is sane, he will be executed, but if Martin declares him insane with multi-personality disorder as Stewart had believed, Edward will be spared.\n\nWhen Martin takes a seat to interrogate Edward, the inmate refuses to be identified as a human and instead a demon inhabiting Edward's body named \"Nefariamous,\" a name Satan gave him  \"Nefarious\" for short. Martin does not believe Nefarious is who he says he is and thinks instead that it is an act by Edward to seem insane; however, he is surprised when Nefarious insists that he wants to be executed, or rather, that he wants Edward to be executed. Nefarious also explains that before the day is over, Martin will commit three murders.\n\nMartin, an atheist, balks at this idea but plays along, asking Nefarious how he came to inhabit Edward. Nefarious explains that he possessed Edward through a process carried out through Edward\u2019s life, beginning with ease of access through Edward\u2019s never having been [baptized](baptized), continuing through seemingly innocuous events such as Edward\u2019s grandmother having given him a [board](ouija)(ouija board) as a present, allowing manipulative communication, finally completing the process only after Edward consented to the possession multiple times. Martin brings in a chaplain to confront the demon in Edward, which frightens Nefarious until he realizes that the priest does not believe in demons and therefore has no effect on him. Martin then asks to talk to Edward, causing Nefarious to recede and produce a timid, childlike Edward who is terribly distraught and shaken by his possession. Edward insists that he is possessed and that the demon had murdered multiple people using his innocent body as a vessel.\n\nWhen Martin begins probing further, Nefarious takes control and insists that Martin euthanized his terminally ill mother to acquire her massive wealth. Martin becomes angry and threatens to leave the meeting, but changes his mind. When Martin decides to write Nefarious off as insane, Nefarious explains that Martin's girlfriend is pregnant, and because Martin threatened to leave her, she is terminating her pregnancy. Overcome with curiosity, Martin begs a kindly prison guard for access to a phone, which he uses to call the health clinic from where he realizes his girlfriend has just finished with the abortion. Nefarious cackles with glee, explaining to Martin that \"all hell is rejoicing.\"\n\nMartin still remains doubtful Nefarious is possessed, but is fully intrigued to hear what the inmate has to tell him. After Martin insists that the world is reclaiming the moral high ground, Nefarious laughs before telling him there is currently an influx of slavery and human trafficking which the demons are helping with. Nefarious then explains he wants Martin to write a book called *The Dark Gospel*, which is his Satanic equivalent to the Bible and will begin another world religion in servitude to demons. Martin is called away by Warden Moss who reveals to him that upon searching Edward's prison cell, they found documentation of Martin's life as Nefarious had done with all his other victims, as well as the dark gospel which Edward wrote, crediting it to Martin's name. Martin, now believing Edward is faking split personalities, confronts Nefarious about this. Nefarious breaks his own hand to slip free of one of the cuffs and seizes Martin, threatening to break his neck unless Martin begs for his life. Overcome with terror, Martin begs Nefarious to spare him to which Nefarious complies before being beaten down by the prison guards. Instinctively, Martin declares that Edward is sane, but not before being warned by a triumphant Nefarious that he is condemning Edward to death.\n\nAs Edward is in the electric chair, Nefarious possesses his body for a final time, asking if Martin accepts his offer, to which Martin silently refuses. Disappointed, Nefarious leaves Edward's body, causing Edward to suffer an extremely painful and terrible death in the chair. The demon then tells Martin, \"You should have accepted my offer,\" before possessing him and trying to force Martin to commit suicide. However, Martin inadvertently prays to God for help, causing the gun to misfire and Nefarious to let go of him. One year later, a visibly changed Martin is shown promoting Nefarious' book  not as a \"dark gospel\" but as a rewritten cautionary tale for people to read and realize the demonic influence in society. On his way home, Martin bumps into a homeless woman whom Nefarious has now possessed.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Nefarious (short for Nefariamous).","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","generation_ms":61559.9548816681,"scoring_ms":0.0269412994,"total_ms":61982.6669692993,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Nefarious","reward":0.0,"judge_reward_func":0.0}
