Bethesda advertised that the edition would include a [canvas](canvas) [bag](duffel)(duffel bag), but a [nylon](nylon) one was included instead. Responding to customer complaints, Bethesda claimed that the bag had to be changed due to unavailability of materials, and initially stated the intention to take no action. The publisher received criticism for not making the change known beforehand, with *[Eurogamer](Eurogamer)* pointing out that the bag's description on Bethesda's website had only changed to read \"nylon\" after complaints had been submitted. Bethesda later offered affected customers free in-game currency of 500 atoms as compensation, equivalent to . Critics pointed out this amount of currency was not enough to purchase the in-game postman uniform (700 atoms), which includes a canvas bag. Additionally, it was discovered that Bethesda had produced a different *Fallout 76*\u2013themed canvas bag and given them for free to [influencers](online)(Internet celebrity), further adding to the fan outrage. Bethesda announced on December 3, 2018, that they would be producing canvas bags for all owners of the Power Armor special edition, which were ultimately said to be shipping \"in four to six months.\" In June 2019, the bags were delivered to customers.\n\nA [breach](data)(data breach) occurred on December 5, 2018, when a [glitch](glitch) in Bethesda's [system](support)(Issue tracking system) revealed personal information of approximately 65 *Fallout 76* customers who had submitted a support ticket to receive the canvas bag. Users were able to open and close tickets of other customers and view personal information, including names, addresses, emails and partial credit card information. In a statement given to *[Technica](Ars)(Ars Technica)*, Bethesda said that the breach occurred via \"an error with our customer support website\" and that they are \"investigating the incident and will provide additional updates as we learn more\". The publisher clarified that the only information leaked were details that the support site would have requested, rather than credit card numbers or passwords, and that they would notify all affected customers.\n\nIn 2018, Bethesda partnered with the Silver Screen Bottling Company to create \"Nuka Dark Rum\", an alcoholic beverage based on the in-game \"Nuka-Cola Dark\" introduced in the *[4: Nuka-World](Fallout)(Fallout 4: Nuka-World)* [add-on](Downloadable content). The rum was available to be pre-ordered in August 2018 for . While its release was expected to coincide with the launch of *Fallout 76*, the rum was delayed and was shipped instead in late December 2018. Upon receiving it, fans criticized the fact that the rum bottle advertised, previously expected to be a bottle in the missile-like shape of the in-game Nuka-Cola item, had turned out to be a standard glass bottle encased in a large plastic cover. The rum's asking price of $80 was subsequently condemned from expectations that the design would be of high quality, since none of the marketing had stated what the bottles would be made of.\n\nIn September 2019, collectible \"Nuka Cola\"\u2013themed *Fallout* helmets produced by Chronicle Collectibles, of which only 32 of the 20,000 manufactured were sold, were recalled by the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](U.S.)(U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission) due to containing high levels of mold and posing a health risk. No incidents or injuries were reported. [GameStop](GameStop), which sold the helmets, notified all customers who had purchased a helmet and offered them a full refund.\n\nIn June 2022, a *Kotaku* article published reports from ten anonymous former employees of Bethesda and its parent company [Media](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Media) of severe mismanagement during *Fallout 76*s development. The reports claimed that [crunch](Crunch (video games)) had been enforced, leading to an \"exodus\" of senior developers from the company. The loss of staff led to Bethesda borrowing developers working on [Studios](Arkane)(Arkane Studios)' *[Redfall](Redfall)* and Bethesda's *[Starfield](Starfield (video game))* to assist with *Fallout 76*. Other alleged issues included technical problems with the game's design and engine, as well as these concerns being ignored by senior management. The sources expressed cynicism towards an improvement of working conditions at Bethesda (following their acquisition by Microsoft), saying \"It would be great if something like [ABetterABK](ABK Workers Alliance) existed for Bethesda [...] But everyone is terrified...because [Bethesda] HR is super cutthroat.\"\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Bethesda advertised the Power Armor Edition would include a canvas duffel bag, but customers received a cheaper nylon bag instead.

Before meeting Edward, Martin reveals to the warden, Moss, that he was brought in to fill in for Dr. Stewart, who was Edward's regular visitor for this procedure. Stewart had died by suicide the night before, causing Martin to replace him. Edward is scheduled to die via electrocution at his insistence that very day and Moss explains to Martin that Edward's fate depends upon Martin's diagnosis; if Martin deduces that Edward is sane, he will be executed, but if Martin declares him insane with multi-personality disorder as Stewart had believed, Edward will be spared.\n\nWhen Martin takes a seat to interrogate Edward, the inmate refuses to be identified as a human and instead a demon inhabiting Edward's body named \"Nefariamous,\" a name Satan gave him  \"Nefarious\" for short. Martin does not believe Nefarious is who he says he is and thinks instead that it is an act by Edward to seem insane; however, he is surprised when Nefarious insists that he wants to be executed, or rather, that he wants Edward to be executed. Nefarious also explains that before the day is over, Martin will commit three murders.\n\nMartin, an atheist, balks at this idea but plays along, asking Nefarious how he came to inhabit Edward. Nefarious explains that he possessed Edward through a process carried out through Edward\u2019s life, beginning with ease of access through Edward\u2019s never having been [baptized](baptized), continuing through seemingly innocuous events such as Edward\u2019s grandmother having given him a [board](ouija)(ouija board) as a present, allowing manipulative communication, finally completing the process only after Edward consented to the possession multiple times. Martin brings in a chaplain to confront the demon in Edward, which frightens Nefarious until he realizes that the priest does not believe in demons and therefore has no effect on him. Martin then asks to talk to Edward, causing Nefarious to recede and produce a timid, childlike Edward who is terribly distraught and shaken by his possession. Edward insists that he is possessed and that the demon had murdered multiple people using his innocent body as a vessel.\n\nWhen Martin begins probing further, Nefarious takes control and insists that Martin euthanized his terminally ill mother to acquire her massive wealth. Martin becomes angry and threatens to leave the meeting, but changes his mind. When Martin decides to write Nefarious off as insane, Nefarious explains that Martin's girlfriend is pregnant, and because Martin threatened to leave her, she is terminating her pregnancy. Overcome with curiosity, Martin begs a kindly prison guard for access to a phone, which he uses to call the health clinic from where he realizes his girlfriend has just finished with the abortion. Nefarious cackles with glee, explaining to Martin that \"all hell is rejoicing.\"\n\nMartin still remains doubtful Nefarious is possessed, but is fully intrigued to hear what the inmate has to tell him. After Martin insists that the world is reclaiming the moral high ground, Nefarious laughs before telling him there is currently an influx of slavery and human trafficking which the demons are helping with. Nefarious then explains he wants Martin to write a book called *The Dark Gospel*, which is his Satanic equivalent to the Bible and will begin another world religion in servitude to demons. Martin is called away by Warden Moss who reveals to him that upon searching Edward's prison cell, they found documentation of Martin's life as Nefarious had done with all his other victims, as well as the dark gospel which Edward wrote, crediting it to Martin's name. Martin, now believing Edward is faking split personalities, confronts Nefarious about this. Nefarious breaks his own hand to slip free of one of the cuffs and seizes Martin, threatening to break his neck unless Martin begs for his life. Overcome with terror, Martin begs Nefarious to spare him to which Nefarious complies before being beaten down by the prison guards. Instinctively, Martin declares that Edward is sane, but not before being warned by a triumphant Nefarious that he is condemning Edward to death.\n\nAs Edward is in the electric chair, Nefarious possesses his body for a final time, asking if Martin accepts his offer, to which Martin silently refuses. Disappointed, Nefarious leaves Edward's body, causing Edward to suffer an extremely painful and terrible death in the chair. The demon then tells Martin, \"You should have accepted my offer,\" before possessing him and trying to force Martin to commit suicide. However, Martin inadvertently prays to God for help, causing the gun to misfire and Nefarious to let go of him. One year later, a visibly changed Martin is shown promoting Nefarious' book  not as a \"dark gospel\" but as a rewritten cautionary tale for people to read and realize the demonic influence in society. On his way home, Martin bumps into a homeless woman whom Nefarious has now possessed.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The demon calls himself \"Nefariamous,\" and goes by the shorter name \"Nefarious.\"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","generation_ms":23639.3227577209,"scoring_ms":0.0469684601,"total_ms":24080.2845954895,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Nefarious","reward":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Directed by [Fowler](Jeff)(Jeff Fowler) (in his feature directorial debut) and written by [Casey](Pat)(Patrick Casey (writer)) and [Miller](Josh)(Josh Miller (filmmaker)), it stars [Schwartz](Ben)(Ben Schwartz) as the voice of [the Hedgehog](Sonic)(Sonic the Hedgehog (character)), alongside [Marsden](James)(James Marsden), [Sumpter](Tika)(Tika Sumpter), [Rothwell](Natasha)(Natasha Rothwell), [Pally](Adam)(Adam Pally), [Majdoub](Lee)(Lee Majdoub), [McDonough](Neal)(Neal McDonough), and [Carrey](Jim)(Jim Carrey). The film follows Sonic (voiced by Schwartz), a blue [anthropomorphic](Anthropomorphism) hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds. He teams up with a town sheriff, Tom Wachowski (Marsden), to stop the mad scientist [Robotnik](Dr.)(Doctor Eggman) (Carrey).\n\nDevelopment for a *Sonic* film began in the 1990s but did not leave the planning stage until [Pictures](Sony)(Sony Pictures) acquired the rights in 2013. Fowler was brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in [turnaround](Turnaround (filmmaking)), [Pictures](Paramount)(Paramount Pictures) acquired it in 2017. Most of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in [Vancouver](Vancouver) and on [Island](Vancouver)(Vancouver Island). Following the negative reaction to the first trailer's reveal of Sonic's appearance in April of 2019, Paramount delayed the film release by three months, taking five months to redesign Sonic in the meanwhile.\n\n*Sonic the Hedgehog* premiered at the Paramount Pictures studio lot on January 25, 2020, before being theatrically released in the United States on February 14. It set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a [game film](video)(List of films based on video games) in the United States and Canada and grossed  worldwide, becoming the [highest-grossing film of 2020](sixth)(2020 in film#Highest-grossing films), and was the highest-grossing video game film adaptation of all time in North America until 2022, when it was surpassed by its sequel. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its action sequences, performances (particularly Schwartz and Carrey's), visual effects, and Sonic's redesign and charm, but criticized its screenplay and product placement.\n\n*[the Hedgehog 2](Sonic)(Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (film))* was released in 2022, while *[the Hedgehog 3](Sonic)(Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (film))* is scheduled for 2024.

collectively known as the M270 MLRS Self-Propelled Loader\/Launcher (SPLL). The SPLL is composed of three primary subsystems: the M269 Loader Launcher Module (LLM), which also houses the electronic Fire Control System, is mated to the M993 Carrier Vehicle.\n\n[[Force XXI Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle ATTP.jpg|thumb|Task Force XXI Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle (ATTP)](File:Task)]\n\nThe M993 is the designation of the M987 carrier when it is used in the MLRS. The M987\/M993 is a lengthened derivative of the [Fighting Vehicle](Bradley)(Bradley Fighting Vehicle) chassis. The ground contact length is increased from  to . Originally called the Fighting Vehicle System, the M987 chassis was designed to serve as the basis for many other vehicles. These included the XM1070 Electronic Fighting Vehicle, the M4 Command and Control Vehicle, the Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle and the Forward Area Armored Logistics System (encompassing three vehicles including the XM1007 AFARV rearm vehicle.\n\nThe original GSRS plan called for 210&nbsp;mm diameter rockets. After European allies became involved with the project, these were replaced with 227&nbsp;mm rockets in order to accommodate the [mine](AT2)(AT2 mine).\n\n[War](Cold)(Cold War) doctrine for the M270 was for the vehicles to spread out individually and hide until needed, then move to a firing position and launch their rockets, immediately move away to a reloading point, then move to a completely new hiding position near a different firing point. These [shoot-and-scoot](shoot-and-scoot) tactics were planned to avoid susceptibility to Soviet [fire](counterbattery)(counterbattery fire). One M270 firing 12 [M26](M26 artillery rocket) rockets would drop 7,728 bomblets, and one MLRS battery of nine launchers firing 108 rockets had the equivalent firepower of 33 battalions of cannon artillery.\n\nThe system can fire rockets or [ATACMS](MGM-140)(MGM-140 ATACMS) missiles, which are contained in interchangeable pods. Each pod contains six standard rockets or one guided ATACMS missile; the two types cannot be mixed. The LLM can hold two pods at a time, which are hand-loaded using an integrated winch system. All twelve rockets or two ATACMS missiles can be fired in under a minute. One launcher firing twelve rockets can completely blanket one square [kilometer](kilometer) with [submunitions](cluster bomb). A typical MLRS cluster salvo consisted of three M270 vehicles each firing all 12 rockets. With each rocket containing 644 [grenades](M77)(Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition), the entire salvo would drop 23,184 grenades in the target area. However, with a two percent dud rate, that would leave approximately 400 undetonated bombs scattered over the area, which could endanger friendly troops and civilians.[After Cluster Bombs: Raining Nails](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2008\/05\/after-cluster-b\/) , *Wired*, 30 May 2008\n\nProduction of the M270 ended in 2003, when a last batch was delivered to the [Army](Egyptian)(Egyptian Army). In 2003, the U.S. Army began low-rate production of the [HIMARS](M142)(M142 HIMARS). The HIMARS fires all of the munitions of the MLRS, but is based on the chassis of the [of Medium Tactical Vehicles](Family)(Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles). As of 2012, BAE Systems still had the capability to restart production of the MLRS.\n\nIn 2006, MLRS was upgraded to fire guided rounds. Phase I testing of a guided unitary round (XM31) was completed on an accelerated schedule in March 2006. Due to an Urgent Need Statement, the guided unitary round was quickly fielded and used in action in [Iraq](Iraq War).[\"Guided MLRS Unitary Rocket Successfully Tested\"](http:\/\/www.mwjournal.com\/journal\/article.asp?HH_ID=AR_609) , *Microwave Journal*, Vol. 49, No. 3 (March 2006), p. 39. [Martin](Lockheed)(Lockheed Martin) also received a contract to convert existing M30 [Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM)](Dual-Purpose)(Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition) GMLRS rockets to the XM31 unitary variant.\n\nThe M31 GMLRS Unitary rocket transformed the M270 into a point target artillery system for the first time. Due to [Positioning System](Global)(Global Positioning System) (GPS) guidance and a single  high-explosive warhead, the M31 could hit targets accurately with less chance of collateral damage while needing fewer rockets to be fired, reducing logistical requirements. The unitary warhead also made the MLRS able to be used in urban environments. The M31 had a dual-mode fuse with point detonation and delay options to defeat soft targets and lightly fortified bunkers respectively, with the upgraded M31A1 equipped with a multi-mode fuse adding a [proximity](proximity fuze) [airburst](air burst) mode for use against personnel in the open; proximity mode can be set for  Height Of Burst (HOB). The GMLRS has a minimum engagement range of  and can hit a target out to , impacting at a speed of Mach 2.5.[M31 GMLRS Unitary](http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/military\/systems\/munitions\/m31.htm) , Global security.[Precision Fires Rocket & Missile Systems](http:\/\/www.msl.army.mil\/Pages\/PFRMS\/pgmr.html) , MSL Army. In 2009 Lockheed Martin announced that a GMLRS had been successfully test fired out to .\n\nA German developmental artillery system, called the [Gun Module](Artillery)(Artillery Gun Module), has used the MLRS chassis on its developmental vehicles.\n\nIn 2012, a contract was issued to improve the armor of the M270s and improve the fire control to the standards of the M142 HIMARS. In June 2015, the M270A1 conducted tests of firing rockets after upgrades from the Improved Armored Cab project, which provides the vehicle with an enhanced armored cab and windows.[Improved Multiple Launch Rocket System tested at White Sands Missile Range](http:\/\/www.army.mil\/article\/153172\/Improved_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System_tested_at_White_Sands_Missile_Range\/) , Army, 31 July 2015\n\nIn early March 2021, Lockheed announced they had successfully fired an extended-range version of the GMLRS out to , part of an effort to increase the rocket's range to .

Ventura), 1982]]\n\nWhen he purchased the WWF in 1982, professional wrestling was a business run by regional promotions. Various promoters understood that they would not invade each other's territories, as this practice had gone on undeterred for decades; McMahon had a different vision of what the industry could become. In 1983, the WWF split from the [Wrestling Alliance](National)(National Wrestling Alliance) a second time, after initially splitting from them in 1963 before rejoining them in 1971. The NWA became the governing body for all the regional territories across the country and as far away as Japan.\n\nHe began expanding the company nationally by promoting in areas outside of the company's Northeast U.S. stomping grounds and by signing talent from other companies, such as the [Wrestling Association](American)(American Wrestling Association) (AWA). In 1984, he recruited [Hogan](Hulk)(Hulk Hogan) to be the WWF's charismatic new megastar, and the two quickly drew the ire of industry peers as the promotion began traveling and broadcasting into rival territories. McMahon, who still also fronted as the WWF's squeaky clean babyface announcer, created ''[Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection](The)(1980s professional wrestling boom)'' by incorporating pop music stars into wrestling storylines.\n\nAs a result, the WWF was able to expand its fanbase into a national mainstream audience as the promotion was featured heavily on MTV programming. On March 31, 1985, he ran [first WrestleMania](the)(WrestleMania I) at [Square Garden](Madison)(Madison Square Garden), available on [circuit television](closed)(closed circuit television) in various markets throughout the United States. McMahon's success of birthing [WrestleMania](WrestleMania) in the 1980s had a significant impact on the [professional wrestling boom](1980s)(1980s professional wrestling boom) during the Golden Age Era.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, McMahon shaped the WWF into a unique sports entertainment brand that reached out to family audiences while attracting fans who hadn't paid attention to pro wrestling before. By directing his storylines toward highly publicized supercards, McMahon capitalized on a fledgling revenue stream by promoting these events live on [pay-per-view](pay-per-view) television. In 1987, the WWF reportedly drew 93,173 fans to the [Silverdome](Pontiac)(Silverdome) (which was called the \"biggest crowd in sports-entertainment history\") for [III](WrestleMania)(WrestleMania III), which featured the main event of Hulk Hogan vs. [the Giant](Andr\u00e9)(Andr\u00e9 the Giant).\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_y2WQCISmRrOSRVhVuEb1sp89\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Titan Sports founded Titan Sports Inc.
