(6994969674).jpg|thumb|upright|The Qutub Minar, Delhi](File:Qutub)]\n\n[Chauhan](Prithviraj)(Prithviraj Chauhan) was defeated in 1192 by [Ghori](Muhammad)(Muhammad of Ghor) in the [battle of Tarain](second)(second battle of Tarain). [Aibak](Qutb-ud-din)(Qutb al-Din Aibak), was given the responsibility of governing the conquered territories of India after Ghori returned to his capital, [Ghor](Ghor Province). When Ghori died without an heir in 1206 CE,  Qutb-ud-din assumed control of Ghori's Indian possessions, and laid the foundation of the [Sultanate](Delhi)(Delhi Sultanate) and the [dynasty](Mamluk)(Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)). He began construction of the [Minar](Qutb)(Qutb Minar) and [Quwwat-al-Islam](Qutb complex) (Might of Islam) mosque, the earliest extant mosque in India. It was his successor, [Iltutmish](Iltutmish) (1211\u20131236), who consolidated the Turkic conquest of northern India.  At , the [Minar](Qutb)(Qutb Minar), a [World Heritage Site](UNESCO)(List of World Heritage Sites in India) in Delhi, was completed during the reign of Sultan [Illtutmish](Illtutmish) in the 13th century. Although its style has some similarities with the [minaret](Jarkurgan)(Jarkurgan minaret), it is more closely related to the [Ghaznavid](Ghaznavid) and [Ghurid](Ghurid) minarets of [Asia](Central)(Central Asia) [Razia](Razia Sultana), daughter of Iltutmish, became the Sultana of Delhi upon the former's death.\n\nFor the next three hundred years, Delhi was ruled by a succession of [Turkic](Turkic peoples) and an [Afghan](Afghans), [dynasty](Lodi)(Lodi dynasty). They built several forts and townships that are part of the [cities of Delhi](seven)(History of Delhi). Delhi was a major centre of [Sufism](Sufism) during this period. The [Sultanate (Delhi)](Mamluk)(Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)) was overthrown in 1290 by [ud din Firuz Khalji](Jalal)(Jalal-ud-din Khalji) (1290\u20131320). Under the second Khalji ruler, [Khalji](Ala-ud-din)(Alauddin Khalji), the Delhi sultanate extended its control south of the [River](Narmada)(Narmada River) in the Deccan. The Delhi sultanate reached its greatest extent during the reign of [bin Tughluq](Muhammad)(Muhammad bin Tughluq) (1325\u20131351). In an attempt to bring the whole of the Deccan under control, he moved his capital to [Maharashtra](Daulatabad,)(Daulatabad, Maharashtra) in central India. However, by moving away from Delhi he lost control of the north and was forced to return to Delhi to restore order. The southern provinces then broke away. In the years following the reign of [Shah Tughlaq](Firoz)(Firoz Shah Tughlaq) (1351\u20131388), the [Sultanate](Delhi)(Delhi Sultanate) rapidly began to lose its hold over its northern provinces. Delhi was captured and sacked by [Timur](Timur) in 1398, who massacred 100,000 captive civilian.[*Genocide: a history*](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=nMMAk4VwLLwC&pg=PA28) . W.D. Rubinstein (2004). p. 28.  Delhi's decline continued under the [dynasty](Sayyid)(Sayyid dynasty) (1414\u20131451), until the sultanate was reduced to Delhi and its hinterland. Under the Afghan [dynasty](Lodi)(Lodi dynasty) (1451\u20131526), the Delhi sultanate recovered control of Punjab and the Gangetic plain to once again achieve domination over Northern India. However, the recovery was short-lived and the sultanate was destroyed in 1526 by [Babur](Babur), founder of the [dynasty](Mughal)(Mughal Empire).\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The monument in Delhi that was completed during the reign of Sultan Iltutmish in the 13th century and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site is the Qutub Minar.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","generation_ms":19858.350276947,"scoring_ms":0.0379085541,"total_ms":20155.0922393799,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Qutub Minar","reward":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Upon receiving it, fans criticized the fact that the rum bottle advertised, previously expected to be a bottle in the missile-like shape of the in-game Nuka-Cola item, had turned out to be a standard glass bottle encased in a large plastic cover. The rum's asking price of $80 was subsequently condemned from expectations that the design would be of high quality, since none of the marketing had stated what the bottles would be made of.\n\nIn September 2019, collectible \"Nuka Cola\"\u2013themed *Fallout* helmets produced by Chronicle Collectibles, of which only 32 of the 20,000 manufactured were sold, were recalled by the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](U.S.)(U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission) due to containing high levels of mold and posing a health risk.

Before meeting Edward, Martin reveals to the warden, Moss, that he was brought in to fill in for Dr. Stewart, who was Edward's regular visitor for this procedure. Stewart had died by suicide the night before, causing Martin to replace him. Edward is scheduled to die via electrocution at his insistence that very day and Moss explains to Martin that Edward's fate depends upon Martin's diagnosis; if Martin deduces that Edward is sane, he will be executed, but if Martin declares him insane with multi-personality disorder as Stewart had believed, Edward will be spared.\n\nWhen Martin takes a seat to interrogate Edward, the inmate refuses to be identified as a human and instead a demon inhabiting Edward's body named \"Nefariamous,\" a name Satan gave him  \"Nefarious\" for short. Martin does not believe Nefarious is who he says he is and thinks instead that it is an act by Edward to seem insane; however, he is surprised when Nefarious insists that he wants to be executed, or rather, that he wants Edward to be executed. Nefarious also explains that before the day is over, Martin will commit three murders.\n\nMartin, an atheist, balks at this idea but plays along, asking Nefarious how he came to inhabit Edward. Nefarious explains that he possessed Edward through a process carried out through Edward\u2019s life, beginning with ease of access through Edward\u2019s never having been [baptized](baptized), continuing through seemingly innocuous events such as Edward\u2019s grandmother having given him a [board](ouija)(ouija board) as a present, allowing manipulative communication, finally completing the process only after Edward consented to the possession multiple times. Martin brings in a chaplain to confront the demon in Edward, which frightens Nefarious until he realizes that the priest does not believe in demons and therefore has no effect on him. Martin then asks to talk to Edward, causing Nefarious to recede and produce a timid, childlike Edward who is terribly distraught and shaken by his possession. Edward insists that he is possessed and that the demon had murdered multiple people using his innocent body as a vessel.\n\nWhen Martin begins probing further, Nefarious takes control and insists that Martin euthanized his terminally ill mother to acquire her massive wealth. Martin becomes angry and threatens to leave the meeting, but changes his mind. When Martin decides to write Nefarious off as insane, Nefarious explains that Martin's girlfriend is pregnant, and because Martin threatened to leave her, she is terminating her pregnancy. Overcome with curiosity, Martin begs a kindly prison guard for access to a phone, which he uses to call the health clinic from where he realizes his girlfriend has just finished with the abortion. Nefarious cackles with glee, explaining to Martin that \"all hell is rejoicing.\"\n\nMartin still remains doubtful Nefarious is possessed, but is fully intrigued to hear what the inmate has to tell him. After Martin insists that the world is reclaiming the moral high ground, Nefarious laughs before telling him there is currently an influx of slavery and human trafficking which the demons are helping with. Nefarious then explains he wants Martin to write a book called *The Dark Gospel*, which is his Satanic equivalent to the Bible and will begin another world religion in servitude to demons. Martin is called away by Warden Moss who reveals to him that upon searching Edward's prison cell, they found documentation of Martin's life as Nefarious had done with all his other victims, as well as the dark gospel which Edward wrote, crediting it to Martin's name. Martin, now believing Edward is faking split personalities, confronts Nefarious about this. Nefarious breaks his own hand to slip free of one of the cuffs and seizes Martin, threatening to break his neck unless Martin begs for his life. Overcome with terror, Martin begs Nefarious to spare him to which Nefarious complies before being beaten down by the prison guards. Instinctively, Martin declares that Edward is sane, but not before being warned by a triumphant Nefarious that he is condemning Edward to death.\n\nAs Edward is in the electric chair, Nefarious possesses his body for a final time, asking if Martin accepts his offer, to which Martin silently refuses. Disappointed, Nefarious leaves Edward's body, causing Edward to suffer an extremely painful and terrible death in the chair. The demon then tells Martin, \"You should have accepted my offer,\" before possessing him and trying to force Martin to commit suicide. However, Martin inadvertently prays to God for help, causing the gun to misfire and Nefarious to let go of him. One year later, a visibly changed Martin is shown promoting Nefarious' book  not as a \"dark gospel\" but as a rewritten cautionary tale for people to read and realize the demonic influence in society. On his way home, Martin bumps into a homeless woman whom Nefarious has now possessed.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The name of the demon possessing the death-row inmate in the film \"Nefarious\" is \"Nefariamous,\" which Satan shortened to \"Nefarious.\"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","generation_ms":20180.5198192596,"scoring_ms":0.036239624,"total_ms":20635.6861591339,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Nefarious","reward":0.0,"judge_reward_func":0.0}

At [2019](E3)(E3 2019), Xbox Game Studios announced it had acquired [Fine](Double)(Double Fine), and established a new internal studio dedicated to *Age of Empires* headed by Shannon Loftis, bringing their total studio count to fifteen. This studio, later named World's Edge, does not directly develop any games, but oversees efforts from external studios, such as [Entertainment](Relic)(Relic Entertainment), Forgotten Empires and [Media](Tantalus)(Tantalus Media), to assure the series is being developed in the right direction, according to creative director Adam Isgreen.\n\nBooty has stated that with studios like Obsidian, Ninja Theory, and Double Fine, which have traditionally supported multiplatform games, they will determine if it makes sense for their future products to be treated as Microsoft-exclusive content for Xbox and Windows computers, or to allow these to be published across multiple platforms. That decision will be based on a \"network effect\", whether having these games on other platforms will better support the franchise and thus worthwhile for Microsoft to help dedicate resources towards it, such as they had with *Minecraft*. Xbox Game Studios has allowed some of the content developed by its studios or that was previously published exclusively for the Xbox and Windows systems to be released on [Nintendo](Nintendo) systems, notably the [Switch](Nintendo)(Nintendo Switch) versions of *[Cuphead](Cuphead)* from Studio MDHR and *[and the Blind Forest](Ori)(Ori and the Blind Forest)* from Moon Studios, and allowing for the titular characters from Rare's *[Banjo-Kazooie](Banjo-Kazooie)* into *[Smash Bros. Ultimate](Super)(Super Smash Bros. Ultimate)*. However, the division stated that these releases were generally \"existing commitments to other platforms\" that they allowed studios to honor, but they otherwise have \"no plans to further expand our exclusive first party games to other consoles.\"\n\nNear the end of 2019, with the combined fifteen studios now under Xbox Game Studios, Booty stated that they now had more games than ever to handle, and were likely not going to acquire any additional studios in the near future, stating \"we've been shifting our focus inside Xbox Game Studios from acquisition and growth, to a phase of execution and delivery\". Additionally, as Microsoft started promotion of its fourth-generation of Xbox, including the [Series X](Xbox)(Xbox Series X), Booty stated that titles developed by Xbox Game Studios in year or two following its release will not be exclusively for the new generation of consoles, but instead will support both Xbox One and the new console, with some games receiving enhanced performance when played on the new console lineup. Booty said that with the large number of studios they had recently acquired, as well as ongoing external partnerships and their [Game Pass](Xbox)(Xbox Game Pass) service, the Studios are able to support a \"breadth of offerings in the portfolio\" designed to attract a large number of players. Further, in an interview in November 2020, Phil Spencer said during an interview regarding the future of the Xbox brand that he intends to put more focus on outputting [RPG](Role-playing video game)s, which had to that point been underserved.\n\nMicrosoft and [Media](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Media) announced on September 21, 2020, that Microsoft planned to acquire ZeniMax and its family of studios, which include [Game Studios](Bethesda)(Bethesda Game Studios), [Studios](Arkane)(Arkane Studios), [Software](id)(id Software), [MachineGames](MachineGames), [Gameworks](Tango)(Tango Gameworks), and [Online Studios](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Online Studios), for over  in cash. According to Spencer, the ZeniMax acquisition was intended to give Microsoft a large library of games known around the world, and to expand the library of Xbox Game Pass and [XCloud](XCloud). Both U.S. and European Union regulatory agencies approved the acquisition by early March 2021, and the acquisition was formally completed by March 9, 2021. The total price of the deal was $8.1 billion Bethesda Softworks, the primarily publisher for all of ZeniMax's games, remained as an operational unit under Microsoft with the acquisition and retained all its current leadership. With the acquisition, future games from the studios will be exclusive to Xbox consoles, but existing commitments to other platforms (such as Arkane Studios' *[Deathloop](Deathloop)* and Tango Gameworks' *[Tokyo](Ghostwire:)(Ghostwire: Tokyo)*, which are contractually exclusive to [5](PlayStation)(PlayStation 5)) will still be honored. Spencer stated that Game Pass was also fundamental driver for the acquisition. A preliminary injunction to block the acquisition had been sought in an ongoing class-action lawsuit that ZeniMax faced over *[4](Fallout)(Fallout 4)*, with the plaintiffs in the case arguing that Microsoft could shield ZeniMax's assets from damages should they be found liable after the acquisition. The ZeniMax Board of Directors was dissolved following the Microsoft purchase.\n\nOn January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire [Blizzard](Activision)(Activision Blizzard) in an all-cash deal valued at $68.7 billion. Microsoft stated that this acquisition would make it the third-largest gaming company by revenue, following [Tencent](Tencent) and [Sony](Sony). With the announcement, Microsoft also announced a major change to its corporate structure, with Phil Spencer becoming CEO of the new division Microsoft Gaming, with Matt Booty leading Xbox Game Studios under it. Once approved, Activision Blizzard will then become a subdivision of Microsoft Gaming.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The value of Microsoft's acquisition deal for ZeniMax Media in 2020 was $8.1 billion in cash.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","generation_ms":20645.3540325165,"scoring_ms":0.039100647,"total_ms":21034.0850353241,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"$8.1 billion","reward":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

collectively known as the M270 MLRS Self-Propelled Loader\/Launcher (SPLL). The SPLL is composed of three primary subsystems: the M269 Loader Launcher Module (LLM), which also houses the electronic Fire Control System, is mated to the M993 Carrier Vehicle.\n\n[[Force XXI Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle ATTP.jpg|thumb|Task Force XXI Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle (ATTP)](File:Task)]\n\nThe M993 is the designation of the M987 carrier when it is used in the MLRS. The M987\/M993 is a lengthened derivative of the [Fighting Vehicle](Bradley)(Bradley Fighting Vehicle) chassis. The ground contact length is increased from  to . Originally called the Fighting Vehicle System, the M987 chassis was designed to serve as the basis for many other vehicles. These included the XM1070 Electronic Fighting Vehicle, the M4 Command and Control Vehicle, the Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle and the Forward Area Armored Logistics System (encompassing three vehicles including the XM1007 AFARV rearm vehicle.\n\nThe original GSRS plan called for 210&nbsp;mm diameter rockets. After European allies became involved with the project, these were replaced with 227&nbsp;mm rockets in order to accommodate the [mine](AT2)(AT2 mine).\n\n[War](Cold)(Cold War) doctrine for the M270 was for the vehicles to spread out individually and hide until needed, then move to a firing position and launch their rockets, immediately move away to a reloading point, then move to a completely new hiding position near a different firing point. These [shoot-and-scoot](shoot-and-scoot) tactics were planned to avoid susceptibility to Soviet [fire](counterbattery)(counterbattery fire). One M270 firing 12 [M26](M26 artillery rocket) rockets would drop 7,728 bomblets, and one MLRS battery of nine launchers firing 108 rockets had the equivalent firepower of 33 battalions of cannon artillery.\n\nThe system can fire rockets or [ATACMS](MGM-140)(MGM-140 ATACMS) missiles, which are contained in interchangeable pods. Each pod contains six standard rockets or one guided ATACMS missile; the two types cannot be mixed. The LLM can hold two pods at a time, which are hand-loaded using an integrated winch system. All twelve rockets or two ATACMS missiles can be fired in under a minute. One launcher firing twelve rockets can completely blanket one square [kilometer](kilometer) with [submunitions](cluster bomb). A typical MLRS cluster salvo consisted of three M270 vehicles each firing all 12 rockets. With each rocket containing 644 [grenades](M77)(Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition), the entire salvo would drop 23,184 grenades in the target area. However, with a two percent dud rate, that would leave approximately 400 undetonated bombs scattered over the area, which could endanger friendly troops and civilians.[After Cluster Bombs: Raining Nails](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2008\/05\/after-cluster-b\/) , *Wired*, 30 May 2008\n\nProduction of the M270 ended in 2003, when a last batch was delivered to the [Army](Egyptian)(Egyptian Army). In 2003, the U.S. Army began low-rate production of the [HIMARS](M142)(M142 HIMARS). The HIMARS fires all of the munitions of the MLRS, but is based on the chassis of the [of Medium Tactical Vehicles](Family)(Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles). As of 2012, BAE Systems still had the capability to restart production of the MLRS.\n\nIn 2006, MLRS was upgraded to fire guided rounds. Phase I testing of a guided unitary round (XM31) was completed on an accelerated schedule in March 2006. Due to an Urgent Need Statement, the guided unitary round was quickly fielded and used in action in [Iraq](Iraq War).[\"Guided MLRS Unitary Rocket Successfully Tested\"](http:\/\/www.mwjournal.com\/journal\/article.asp?HH_ID=AR_609) , *Microwave Journal*, Vol. 49, No. 3 (March 2006), p. 39. [Martin](Lockheed)(Lockheed Martin) also received a contract to convert existing M30 [Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM)](Dual-Purpose)(Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition) GMLRS rockets to the XM31 unitary variant.\n\nThe M31 GMLRS Unitary rocket transformed the M270 into a point target artillery system for the first time. Due to [Positioning System](Global)(Global Positioning System) (GPS) guidance and a single  high-explosive warhead, the M31 could hit targets accurately with less chance of collateral damage while needing fewer rockets to be fired, reducing logistical requirements. The unitary warhead also made the MLRS able to be used in urban environments. The M31 had a dual-mode fuse with point detonation and delay options to defeat soft targets and lightly fortified bunkers respectively, with the upgraded M31A1 equipped with a multi-mode fuse adding a [proximity](proximity fuze) [airburst](air burst) mode for use against personnel in the open; proximity mode can be set for  Height Of Burst (HOB). The GMLRS has a minimum engagement range of  and can hit a target out to , impacting at a speed of Mach 2.5.[M31 GMLRS Unitary](http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/military\/systems\/munitions\/m31.htm) , Global security.[Precision Fires Rocket & Missile Systems](http:\/\/www.msl.army.mil\/Pages\/PFRMS\/pgmr.html) , MSL Army. In 2009 Lockheed Martin announced that a GMLRS had been successfully test fired out to .\n\nA German developmental artillery system, called the [Gun Module](Artillery)(Artillery Gun Module), has used the MLRS chassis on its developmental vehicles.\n\nIn 2012, a contract was issued to improve the armor of the M270s and improve the fire control to the standards of the M142 HIMARS. In June 2015, the M270A1 conducted tests of firing rockets after upgrades from the Improved Armored Cab project, which provides the vehicle with an enhanced armored cab and windows.[Improved Multiple Launch Rocket System tested at White Sands Missile Range](http:\/\/www.army.mil\/article\/153172\/Improved_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System_tested_at_White_Sands_Missile_Range\/) , Army, 31 July 2015\n\nIn early March 2021, Lockheed announced they had successfully fired an extended-range version of the GMLRS out to , part of an effort to increase the rocket's range to .

It stands on a platform or [stylobate](stylobate) of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of [and lintel](post)(post and lintel) construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an [entablature](entablature). There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and seventeen on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the *[cella](cella),* which is divided into two compartments. The *[opisthodomos](opisthodomos)* (the back room of the cella) contained the monetary contributions of the Delian League. At either end of the building, the [gable](gable) is finished with a triangular [pediment](pediment) originally occupied by sculpted figures.\n\nThe Parthenon has been described as \"the culmination of the development of the Doric order.\"\"Parthenon.\" *Britannica Library*, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 10 September 2021. Accessed 16 July 2022. The Doric columns, for example, have simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a [frieze](frieze) of carved pictorial panels ([metopes](Metope (architecture))), separated by formal architectural [triglyph](triglyph)s, also typical of the Doric order. The continuous [frieze](frieze) in low relief around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns, in contrast, reflects the Ionic order. Architectural historian John R. Senseney suggests that this unexpected switch between orders was due to an aesthetic choice on the part of builders during construction, and was likely not part of the original plan of the Parthenon.\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are . The cella was 29.8&nbsp;metres long by 19.2&nbsp;metres wide (97.8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;63.0&nbsp;ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure  in diameter and are  high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column having 20 flutes. (A flute is the [concave](wikt:concave) shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as [and tegulae](imbrices)(imbrex and tegula).\n\nThe Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. [Julius Cooper](John)(John Julius Cooper) wrote that \"even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [naos](naos (architecture)) walls, and the [entasis](entasis) of the columns.\"John Julius Norwich, *Great Architecture of the World*, 2001, p. 63 Entasis refers to the slight swelling, of , in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,And in the surviving foundations of the preceding Older Parthenon (Penrose, *Principles of Athenian Architecture* 2nd ed. ch. II.3, plate 9). it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outward, but they actually lean slightly inward so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly  above the centre of the Parthenon. Since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [architrave](architrave) and roof above: \"All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves\", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.Penrose *op. cit.* pp. 32\u201334, found the difference motivated by economies of labour; Gorham P. Stevens, \"Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon\" *American Journal of Archaeology* **66**.3 (July 1962:337\u2013338).\n\n[[East Facade pf the Parthenon on March 22, 2021.jpg|thumb|left|The east facade|upright=1.2](File:The)]\n\nIt is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these \"optical refinements\" was. They may serve as a sort of \"reverse optical illusion.\"Archaeologists discuss similarly curved architecture and offer the theory. *Nova*, \"Secrets of the Parthenon,\" PBS. http:\/\/video.yahoo.com\/watch\/1849622\/6070405 As the Greeks may have been aware, two [parallel](parallel (geometry)) lines appear to bow, or curve outward, when intersected by converging lines. In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves. But the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.\n\nSome studies of the Acropolis, including of the Parthenon and its facade, have conjectured that many of its proportions approximate the [ratio](golden)(golden ratio).Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., \"Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis,\" *Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly*, Vol. 46, 1998. More recent studies have shown that the proportions of the Parthenon do not match the golden proportion.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_N9BvgUf8QITsJKtV2zO7gceS\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"section_id\\\":\\\"parthenon:present_building\\\"}\", \"name\": \"read_section\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"### Present building\n\n[[2018-08-25 (44647579745).jpg|thumb|left|The Parthenon in 2018|upright=1.2](File:Greece)]\n\nIn the mid-5th century BC, when the Athenian Acropolis became the seat of the [League](Delian)(Delian League) and Athens was the greatest cultural centre of its time, [Pericles](Pericles) initiated an ambitious building project that lasted the entire second half of the century. The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today \u2013 the Parthenon, the [Propylaia](Propylaia (Acropolis of Athens)), the [Erechtheion](Erechtheion) and the temple of [Nike](Athena)(Athena Nike) \u2013 were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of [Phidias](Phidias), who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects [Ictinos](Ictinos) and [Callicrates](Callicrates) began their work in 447, and the building was substantially completed by 432. Work on the decorations continued until at least 431.\n\nThe Parthenon was built primarily by men who knew how to work marble. These quarrymen had exceptional skills and were able to cut the blocks of marble to very specific measurements. The quarrymen also knew how to avoid the faults, which were numerous in the [marble](Pentelic)(Pentelic marble). If the marble blocks were not up to standard, the architects would reject them. The marble was worked with iron tools \u2013 picks, points, punches, chisels, and drills. The quarrymen would hold their tools against the marble block and firmly tap the surface of the rock.Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\n\nA big project like the Parthenon attracted stonemasons from far and wide who travelled to Athens to assist in the project. Slaves and foreigners worked together with the Athenian citizens in the building of the Parthenon, doing the same jobs for the same pay. Temple building was a very specialized craft, and there were not many men in Greece qualified to build temples like the Parthenon, so these men would travel around and work where they were needed.\n\nOther craftsmen were necessary for the building of the Parthenon, specifically carpenters and metalworkers. Unskilled labourers also had key roles in the building of the Parthenon. They loaded and unloaded the marble blocks and moved the blocks from place to place. In order to complete a project like the Parthenon, many different labourers were needed, and each played a critical role in constructing the final building.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The two architects responsible for the design of the Parthenon were Ictinos and Callicrates.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","generation_ms":16041.5289402008,"scoring_ms":0.0350475311,"total_ms":16400.6910324097,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Iktinos and Callicrates","reward":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

After a slow start in the worldwide market, it was invigorated in Japan with multiple releases in the *[Hunter](Monster)(Monster Hunter)* series. With the series being less popular in western regions, it failed to revive the platform in the same way. The PSP ended up being a mixed result for the company. It was seen as a success in that it was the only handheld video game platform that had ever significantly competed with Nintendo for market share, with almost 80 million units sold in its lifespan, roughly the same amount as Nintendo's [Boy Advance](Game)(Game Boy Advance) had during the [generation of video game consoles](sixth)(sixth generation of video game consoles).

In the same month, [VG247](VG247) released pictures of an early prototype version showing a [Go](PSP)(PSP Go)-like slide-screen design along with two analog sticks, two cameras and a microphone, though the report mentioned that overheating issues had since caused them to move away from the design in favor of a model more similar to the original PlayStation Portable device.\n\nThroughout 2010, Sony would not confirm these reports of a PSP successor but would make comments regarding making future hardware. [Yoshida](Shuhei)(Shuhei Yoshida), President of [Worldwide Studios](SCE)(SCE Worldwide Studios) revealed that his studio, despite usually being more involved with software, had a continued role in future hardware development at the time. In December, [Computer Entertainment](Sony)(Sony Computer Entertainment) CEO [Hirai](Kazuo)(Kazuo Hirai) stated that Sony aimed to appeal to a wide demographic of people by using multiple input methods on future hardware; buttons and joysticks for traditional handheld game system users, and touchscreens for [phone](smart)(smart phone) users. The device was officially announced by Sony on January 27, 2011, at their \"PlayStation Meeting\" press conference held by the company in Japan. The system, only known by its code name \"Next Generation Portable\", was announced to be a handheld gaming device that aimed for [3](PlayStation)(PlayStation 3) quality visuals, which was later clarified to not be taken at a literal level because, according to David Coombes, platform research manager at [Computer Entertainment America](Sony)(Sony Computer Entertainment America), \"Well, it's not going to run at 2&nbsp;GHz [the PS3](like) because the battery would last five minutes and it would probably set fire to your pants\". Its power was later described by Sony engineers as about halfway between the PSP and PS3. As rumors had suggested, the device was designed to present \"the best of both worlds\" between mobile and handheld gaming, including a 5-inch OLED touchscreen, a rear touchpad coupled with physical buttons and dual analog sticks. Sony also revealed that the device would be using a mix of retail and digital distribution of games. Further details were announced at [Developers Conference](Game)(Game Developers Conference) 2011, including that Sony would be dropping the PSP's [UMD](Universal Media Disc) disc format in favor of small game cartridges of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB size variants.  along with two cameras, facial detection, head detection and tracking capabilities.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Before its official announcement, the PlayStation Vita was known by its codename \"Next Generation Portable\" (NGP).","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","generation_ms":14027.9321670532,"scoring_ms":0.0400543213,"total_ms":14395.6339359283,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Next Generation Portable","reward":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Polar bear fieldwork can also be hazardous to researchers. As of 2015, the [Union for Conservation of Nature](International)(International Union for Conservation of Nature) (IUCN) reports that the global population of polar bears is 22,000 to 31,000, and the current population trend is unknown. Nevertheless, polar bears are listed as \"Vulnerable\" under criterion A3c, which indicates an expected population decrease of \u226530% over the next three generations (~34.5 years) due to \"decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and\/or quality of habitat\". Risks to the polar bear include [change](climate)(climate change), [pollution](pollution) in the form of [toxic](toxic) contaminants, conflicts with shipping, oil and gas exploration and development, and human-bear interactions including harvesting and possible stresses from recreational polar-bear watching.\n\nAccording to the [Wildlife Fund](World)(World Wildlife Fund), the polar bear is important as an [indicator](indicator species) of Arctic [health](ecosystem)(ecosystem health). Polar bears are studied to gain understanding of what is happening throughout the Arctic, because at-risk polar bears are often a sign of something wrong with the Arctic [ecosystem](marine)(marine ecosystem).[WWF: A Leader in Polar Bear Conservation](http:\/\/www.worldwildlife.org\/species\/finder\/polarbear\/polarbear.html#).

The Norwegian text translates into \"Applies to all of Svalbard\".](File:Polar-Bear-Warning-Longyearbyen.jpg|thumb|right|Road)]\n\nConcerns over the future survival of the species led to the development of national regulations on polar bear hunting, beginning in the mid-1950s. The Soviet Union banned all hunting in 1956. Canada began imposing hunting quotas in 1968. Norway passed a series of increasingly strict regulations from 1965 to 1973, and has completely banned hunting since then. The United States began regulating hunting in 1971 and adopted the [Mammal Protection Act](Marine)(Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972) in 1972. In 1973, the [Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears](International)(International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears) was signed by all five nations whose territory is inhabited by polar bears: Canada, Denmark, Norway, the [Union](Soviet)(Soviet Union), and the United States. Member countries agreed to place restrictions on recreational and commercial hunting, ban hunting from aircraft and icebreakers, and conduct further research.[International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20030409113042\/http:\/\/pbsg.npolar.no\/ConvAgree\/agreement.htm), 15 November 1973, Oslo The treaty allows hunting \"by local people using traditional methods\". Norway is the only country of the five in which all harvest of polar bears is banned. The agreement was a rare case of international cooperation during the [War](Cold)(Cold War). Biologist [Stirling](Ian)(Ian Stirling (biologist)) commented, \"For many years, the conservation of polar bears was the only subject in the entire Arctic that nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain could agree upon sufficiently to sign an agreement. Such was the intensity of human fascination with this magnificent predator, the only marine bear.\"[Ian](Stirling,)(Ian Stirling (biologist)) *Foreword* in\n\nAgreements have been made between countries to co-manage their shared polar bear subpopulations. After several years of negotiations, Russia and the United States signed an agreement in October 2000 to jointly set quotas for indigenous subsistence hunting in Alaska and [Chukotka](Chukotka Autonomous Okrug). The treaty was ratified in October 2007. In September 2015, the polar bear range states agreed upon a \"circumpolar action plan\" describing their conservation strategy for polar bears.\n\nThe species is listed in Appendix II of the [on International Trade in Endangered Species](Convention)(Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) (CITES) meaning international trade, including in parts or derivatives, is controlled by the CITES system of permits and certificates. The United States government has proposed that polar bears be transferred to Appendix I of [CITES](CITES) which would ban all commercial international trade in polar bear parts. The decision to leave the species listed under Appendix II was endorsed by the IUCN and [TRAFFIC](TRAFFIC), who determined that such an uplisting was unlikely to confer a conservation benefit.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The five nations that are signatories of the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears are Canada, Denmark, Norway, the Soviet Union (now Russia), and the United States.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","generation_ms":19013.6609077454,"scoring_ms":0.022649765,"total_ms":19836.6205692291,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"},"strict":true},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, United States","reward":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}
